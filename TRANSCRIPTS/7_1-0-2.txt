1	are you pro-choice or
0	I guess it
1	oh okay
1	I am pro-choice
0	so you are for it?
1	well I am not for abortion like but
0	to a degree
0	okay. start there.
1	you can start first.
0	okay well I am against abortion because I mean again it is still a human being in the body even though it is not yet like there yet. but doing abortion still hurts the mom and it is just bad like I feel like you are just killing another like cell like another I mean it is a cell but then again it is a baby too yeah.
1	but do you believe that women should have a choice over their body like
0	yeah but then yeah it is not just their own choice too though it is just their choice is consideration of their the dad whatever the family like agree upon or to
1	what if what if they are incapable of taking care of the child? there are so many children growing up in abusive homes or homes with drug addict moms you know
0	but then there is
0	there is
0	there is, there is like schools that adopt kids too. so
1	what, what, what about those kids that do not get adopted?
0	they still get raised within that like you know that school there is schools for those adopted like those unwanted kids. I mean they are still going to get raised up.
1	so women should just not have the choice over their body?
0	they have the choice I but I still go against it. like just because they have the choice does not necessarily mean I agree with the fact that they can have an abortion
1	but they should have a choice you just do not have to agree with their choice. because we have progressed so much with women's rights. do not you think that this would be like a downfall on how far we have come?
0	okay but
0	well they have the choice they make the choice to have abortion or not I am just saying the fact of abortion is like not prefered by me at least because it just still again is not good for you. like some people can have abortions that women would not ever like would ever like not ever get pregnant again like it is something that is downfall for the woman and I mean that is their choice but
1	and they are probably aware of that too they go get an abortion and and they have read all you know the side effects and stuff so
0	I mean
1	if you were to vote on on it right now you would vote against abortion? because you do not have to necessarily agree with it. it is the woman's choice who is getting the abortion. it has no like effect in your life
0	yeah but then I know someone personally who got abortion this is her third time and it is really really bad for her like it actually the beginning she was like she lived with me she was yakking like everything and she go through all that but it just like the end she is going to give up on it and it is just pretty sad because you already had so many chances
1	but what if she did not get an abortion what would happen since you lived with her what do you think would happen?
0	well she
1	how old was she her first abortion?
1	twenty? so what do you think would happen? would she be able to raise that child in a healthy environment?
0	she might like right now she is considering getting a baby. like now she is twenty three she is thinking about this time for real like getting it but she wants to like send it to her family in China to raise it but I mean she could have done that before too though
1	but do you think that is healthy for the child growing up never knowing his mother?
0	they are going to be there. she is not going to leave him, just
1	do you have a mom here or
1	where is your mom?
1	okay do you miss her?
0	it is not related to me it is like abortion here
1	it is
1	but do you think that is healthy? if she were to send her baby to China?
0	no but she can not raise the baby herself. it will be the better environment for her for the kid to raise there because they have all the family to raise he or she
1	okay but what about all the other cases that do not have family in China or Europe or even in America? what would they do? they can put that child you know up for adoption. that child can move back and forth to foster care and never find a child and then or never find a family and then get kicked out when they are eightee. left alone not knowing how to fend for themselves
0	but the
0	that is the worst case but not everyone gets that. I mean even like um my teacher. like she had an abusive relationship and then she basically had two kids on her own. like she got pregnant and the guy already left her. but she did not decide to give up on that because it is still a human being and it is still her children. it belongs to her that and it is her right # to keep it if she wants to right?
1	but if she did not want to it would be her right not to keep it
0	but that the kids still raised up like their really cute only I seen their pictures too like they are still healthy even though they were (_____)
1	if she chose to keep the baby that means she is aware of her capabilities of raising the child. people who are not you know capable and know they are incapable of raising the child you know they opt for abortion. some do not even necessarily want to abort the child that just is their last option.
0	well again
1	sometimes it is more painful for them to put the child up for adoption than to abort the child
0	well again the topic was abortion so I agree with you to let them make the choice on abortion but I just. abortion is not a think that I would prefer.
1	so so if it were to like vote you would choose yes on abortion because you agree that women should have a choice? because it does not mean like I am you know gung-ho # on let us abort children but
0	I mean yeah like they
0	well ah, it is like just not a good thing to do just thinking about it. like would you agree thinking about like would you do abortion?
1	but I like I do not necessarily agree with war but there is nothing you can really do. it is kinda like that. you do not really agree with it but it is not it is not for us to have say in someone else's life.
0	I mean it is a choice like between getting an abortion or getting not and then yea it is up to them. but the fact abortion is just something I do not agree on.
1	but it is like having it is like having overbearing parents. like you always say to them like it is my life it is not your life. you can not have control over if I go to medical school or if I want to become a doctor what if I want to become a singer? so it is not our it is not our life it is the women out there and they should have the choice whether or not they want to raise a child or not raise a child. abort a child
0	yea it is up to their choice I agreed already # that is their choice but I just not like I do not prefer the fact of abortion. yea I know they had to go through a lot to have the baby but just again it is in your body that is a cell like it is a human being there it is not just one single cell you can lose like that. it is just something really harsh to do too. it is really harsh and hurtful to do so. so yea.
1	okay and then but like what do you say to the people who think that until a certain point in the woman's pregancy term that the baby is not fully developed?
0	well abortion is only given in the beginning stage of their pregnancy cause then after that they can not even do it
1	yea after a certain point
0	yea but
