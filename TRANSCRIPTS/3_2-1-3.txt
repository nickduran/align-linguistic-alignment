0	What do you think?
1	I definitely think that well I'm not like very strongly agreeing but I should think I do think they should lower it to 18 my personal argument is that if at 18 you can vote you can drive a vehicle which is pretty much a killing machine you can go to the army you can go kill someone you can die and stuff like that I think you should be able to at least drink by the year or whatever or at least like in other countries how they do that like beer you can do it at 18 but hard alcohol like vodka whiskey all that you can't until you're 21 um so I definitely think that you should be able to drink when you're 18 in this country what do you think?
0	I think that um well um
1	do you think it should be lowered to 18 or should it stay at 21?
0	I think it should um I don't know like I'm like well I agree with [...] that it shouldn't be lowered yeah I don't think it should be lowered because I think that many like people that like that drink that like they shouldn't expose themselves I think that the younger you start drinking the more you like you know are addicted to it so I don't think that like I come from like like my dad drinks a lot so it's like it's pretty hard seeing him like drink together like like they don't like realize what their doing and we've gotten into arguments over that and I don't want like my little brother to start drinking early and become like him so like I don't think it should be like lowered yeah
1	it should not be okay
1	Is that what you put on the paper? oh okay so my point I mean my parents have always been like open to things like that with me and um ever since I was a young age of course little kids have like that like oh can I try and stuff like that and I think from a very young age I was I grew up around latin people like parties they drink and stuff like that and so I think I was always kind of interested like why or like how does it taste so my parents would give me a little sip of everything from a very young age and I think that allowed me to not like it cause when I was little I was like okay that tastes disgusting like I don't want that and stuff like that and so I've uh I've never had that urge now that I'm 21 to to drink to go out and so I think my point of view is the more you prohibit something especially for kids the more they're going to want to do it you see kids who are not 21 who go out to parties and they drink cause it's like you know it's cool we're not supposed to so let's do it and I completely agree with well pretty much I get your point which is the younger you start the more likely you are to uh become addicted or and then especially if you're allowed to drink obviously you have to be more responsible with your actions so like you said um I think that would also could be a little more dangerous cause like they drink and drive problems accidents people die but I think there should be definitely more education towards what drinking is parents not to hide it so much from their kids and to just uh that's pretty much my main point the more you prohibit something the more teenagers are going to want to do it
0	to drink
0	It's like when my friend and I went to this party you know like she got so drunk and then like she had been taken to the hospital and she got alcohol poisoning and then she turned out and it was allergic and like she spent weeks in the hospital and then I'm thinking okay you're younger you're not supposed to drink why lower the age and it's like lowering the age? I don't think so
1	but do you think that would make more people want to drink more than it more than they already do?
1	It would stay the same
1	okay that's why I'm like I don't know I think it's mainly like personal choice you should know what your limit is so you shouldn't go past it and I know many people do cause they think it's fun but I definitely think that they should be exposed to it from a younger age cause then you can get like the I don't know you know what you're getting through you're getting yourself through so but yeah there are many like counter arguments I could agree with too especially the whole like drinking and driving and just not being responsible enough to take care of yourself but I feel like if you're able to do so many things at 18 because pretty much the only thing that you're not able to is to drink cause you're able to do everything else your you can get convicted as an adult when you're 18 when you're 18 you can vote for president the leader of your country you can go to like enroll for the air force army and all that stuff you can go kill someone with that in the service like obviously protecting your country but I'm like that's ridiculous that you can't drink but then I get you too that there are many people who are more prone to addictions than others and that's not good but I feel like you should already know that if you are more prone you should be more careful and if you have like experiences like you said it's everybody's choice to start or not start what do you think?
0	makes sense
0	you can't drink
0	[...] well everyone has their own choice but personally I have had [...] and I don't like it so why drink you know but then sometime's i'm like I shouldn't be drinking at all so I don't know
1	cause I feel like it's not like when people turn 21 they make this big part big deal like I can finally drink but it's like you've been drinking since you were like younger than 18 so it's not much of a difference at least with the like my friends from highschool and like the friends I know now they're like oh you're finally 21 it's just the point that you're finally legally able to buy it but I've known many cases of like my friends who go and ask someone to buy themm the drinks and stuff like that so I definitely
0	you've been drinking
0	I also think that like if you like it should stay like as 21 cause I feel like it's more the parents feel more secure that their child's not drinking like they're just like okay I'm going to this party but you know like if you've seen other friends or like okay they're not legally allowed
