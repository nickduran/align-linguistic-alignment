participant	content0	okay so do you think marijuana should be legalized or not?1	yeah I think it should.0	uh why do you think it should be legalized?1	I think it should be legalized because a lot of people use it illegally. and um the money that it could bring into our country like in terms of like revenue would definitely put us help put us out of the debt that we are in now. and marijuana has been prove to not have any damage really on the body except from smoking but I mean like I do not think it would damage really anything. people use it illegally anyways. what do you think about it?0	uh personally I think it should not be legalized. # because well hm I do not know where to start. uh well since like I just got out of high school there is um I do not like how there is like tons of like kids that are smoking marijuana now so that is definitely not a good thing and legalizing it would clearly make it a lot easier to access. um what else? first of all so for the first part um if it is easier to access it is easier to distribute around. and do you think that marijuana could be like a gateway drug?1	no absolutely not. honestly that no. I feel like uh alcohol for example is a more um dangerous thing to to do rather than marijuana just because it is it is like the effects that it has on your body like and in the long run you loose memory and things like that. whereas like marijuana now is used like medically and stuff. it has been proven to help patients get out of their pain. and other people I mean I am not going to lie they do abuse the use of marijuna but I feel like if it should be um legalized of course with restrictions so it would not like you said you do not like kids using it. you know maybe they should put like an age um like an age restriction on it. you know we do not want like ten year old kids smoking it and stuff but I think it is it would bring a lot of revenue into the country.0	f course0	so but one of your reasons was um um to use it medically but is not that already legal?1	it is legal yeah that is why I am saying it is already being used medically. some say like other people they abuse that too like they can just go to venice beach and buy a a club card. and just you know like they do not have any use for it in terms of medically so either way it is being turned around and used illegally. so you just legalize it completely um people will be using it and also they will be paying the country for it basically.0	so basically your main point is for the kind of like money for the country.1	yeah # that would be my main point.0	# uh I mean that is always a good thing since we are in like a really deep hole of debt. but I am not sure if the revenue from marijuana would be enough to really like have a lasting effect. I mean will it help? I do not know. maybe maybe not. because people will not be buying it in like bulk where they will just hoard in like billions and billions. of course not. but I think the risk. so basically there is pros and cons and the pros of course is revenue for the country but the cons heavily outweigh it in my opinion.1	what are your cons?0	uh I already listed them. yeah. and I yeah like although you do not think so I think that marijuana could be like a gateway drug to like the more um the more dangerous ones like what is there like cocain uh meth and whatnot.1	I think some I think it just really depends on the person. mostly like if they are what is the word? if they are if they are not if they want to try other drugs like that then they will but I feel like a lot of people just drink and smoke drink and smoke I mean drugs like that personally I would not I would not do it. I mean I am not a heavy smoker or anything but it is like I would not I would not even consider doing it you know other drugs like that.0	yeah maybe if I had more first hand experience with it. I mean not smoking it but maybe having contact or knowing more people that did possibly I do not really do though. so yeah. it is just what I think I have no like scientifical or statistical data to back myself up right here but1	I am yeah.1	yeah um I just feel like like you say we are in such a big hole of debt. it could like I am not going to say that it could potentially work you know like to help close the debt that we have but I think that it would definitely be a good factor in bringing more money in. just because if people use it illegally everywhere they grow it they sell it and it is like that is not um revenue for the country itself it is for your own self. so I feel like if the country imposed some kind of like law it could we could get some money out of it. I mean and of course there are so many there are health risks just because it is like a drug. but it is I feel like marijuana is one of the least um drugs that you know like you can not overdose on it like there is like really not in not like alcohol where you can black out and end up in a hospital or something you know. cocain you can overdose and die. ecstacy. I think marijuana is one of the least dangerous drugs in the world so I feel like it is it is not a big deal if we do like legalize it.0	so if you were to legalize it how do you go around um let us say selling it or distributing it? like similar to cigarettes or1	I do not know. I feel like it would it would definitely probably put more like the the marijuana clubs around just that it would be able to have more access to everyone else.0	like I do not I am not too familiar with marijuana clubs so1	oh okay well basically like if you are if you have been prescribed the use of marijuana for for example you have cancer pain then they have these marijuana clubs that they call it where they sell it. and you just go in with your your card and then they give you the marijuana and stuff but it is like your are buying it but in a legal way. so I thin that if marijuana would be legalized more of these would be established. but like I said of course with like age restrictions. like maybe if you are eighteen then yeah you can buy or twenty one you can use it. and um I think it would defnitely work it that same way.0	well hm so taking into perspective a person that would use marijuana. I would imagine that if it was legalized a person that would leisurely or maybe not even leisurely or whoever would use marijuana would they smoke it more than they even do legally or no?1	it just depends on the person I guess like I mean if it were legalized I think they would probably smoke it more. and they would buy more of it. and then you know like that would be more money for the country basically. I mean I am not really it is all based on for us to close the debt that we are in right now. so yeah like people would probably use it more. they are already abusing it illegally. might as well just let them use it you know out in the open.0	um well although marijuana is on a smaller scale the point you brought up that is like people are using it illegally you should just let them use it. there is a lot of things that people are already using illegally that we should not let them use it.1	yeah I agree. like cocain and stuff0	but so I do not think that is um a viable point to make towards marijuana first of all. and secondly the side effects of marijuana on a person so so what would be the side effects on a person? because these side effects if we were to make it legal let us say if they do it in like public maybe not like at a children's park or something but rather like in public they would be walking around um yeah on the influence. uh what else? I from my experience what is it? second hand marijuana the scent and stuff maybe not as enjoyable for others as with some what else um
