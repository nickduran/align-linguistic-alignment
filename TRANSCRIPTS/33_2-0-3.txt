0	So what do you think about abortion?
1	Um personally I think that um for the current time I think abortion should be legal um but at the same time I think that um we shouldn't be putting as much money into it and we should be putting much more money into finding alternatives and ultimately reducing the number of abortions.
0	So you think like allocation of funds?
1	Yeah I think allocation of funds is a big deal I think we should be spending less money on subsidizing abortions and more on preventative measures adoption and such like that. Um but I think for the current time in a lot of people's situations abortion's a necessary um thing and I think it should be legal.
0	It should be legal?
0	I agree it should be legal um, though my but the only thing that I'm not 100% sure on with what you're saying is you want to you would encourage have going through with the pregnancy and then giving the child up for adoption afterwards?
1	Um I think that would that's one of the things I would push um possibly
0	So that's something you'd push that's something you'd push for?
1	Yeah I would push for that as opposed I would and I would push for um you know uh just oh more spending more money on like cont like contraception and different methods like that and making it more universal you know um and just preventing it in the first place and if not um I mean
0	Prevent it okay.
0	Things like condoms or birth control pushing stuff pushing stuff like that.
1	Yeah like you know providing, yeah and especially like with healthcare and stuff.
0	So for for stuff like that like the contracept the contraceptives like things like Planned Parenthood I don't think that they focus more on the abortion like most of the money isn't going into abortion I feel like it's going more into the contraceptives
1	It is a largely but I think that, a lot of like
0	You still think that it should be the allocation of funds?
1	I think that there and maybe even yeah I think that yeah like allocation of funds is pretty good and I think that you know it should just be largely encouraged I think that you know the way it is um, uh and I don't have the statistics on it but I feel like it like the way our like society and like it's perpetrated as that abortion is just like the best solution and I think that it is a solution for a lot of cases but I think that it should just be you know um you know we should put more money into the alternatives.
0	I mean my my personal opinion is like, it's it's her body so it's her choice. Whatever she wants to do she can do it.
1	No yeah
1	And I agree I I that's what I'm saying like legally speaking like if she wants an abortion I think that should be for her
0	So I do I do believe in that adoption method. I do believe that is a very good possibility if you can follow through with the pregnancy. In a lot of cl in a lot of cases some women just can't go through with that pregnancy and that's where I feel abortion comes in whether it's like familial reasons or, things like other other pressing circumstances I feel like um taking out the funds for Planned Parenthood may not be good
1	And I'm not necessarily, maybe not even reallocating funds but just increasing if it you know just for a temporary time like increasing funds in general and putting more into the alternatives until we reach a point where abortion isn't necessary anymore.
0	I okay.
1	Um if but like I'm saying if for the time being I think in a lot of circumstances it's completely necessary so I think that it should be completely legal uh, at the current time but
0	I agree it should be legal yeah.
1	I think that it and I I don't think it's the best solution but I think it for a lot of people it is so if we could reach a point in our society
0	I mean moral morally I can understand where you're coming from how it would be, uh no I'm just I'm just saying like but I can understand how it would be a good thing to do but, there's another way.
1	Yeah. I don't have any like you know I don't have moral problems with it but you know
1	There's other you know I I personally have um, one of my sisters is adopted so I feel I've seen like a lot of like adoption I think that's like a great option
0	Like if like like if something had happened with that life it'd be yeah
1	I think that yeah and I think that a lot of people I you know a lot of it there's plenty of parents out there who are looking for children um, especially babies like um I mean and maybe that's not the best thing but I think, you know um if, like a lot of children a lot of parents are just forced to you know go to China to get children you know um so I think that you know we can deal with the problem here xxx.
0	I feel I I I understand what you where you're coming from
1	But yeah I do there's uh I don't think abortion should be uh illegalized in any way.
0	Like illegal or anything yeah. I I understand that yeah so if we were to present this as an argument, how would we do this? We so what do we what do we agree on? We agree
1	That abortion should be legal
0	Abortion should be legal. Um, what we don't agree on is the funds. I believe the funds should stay as they are for for Planned Parenthood and organizations like that that deal with this type of thing because
1	But I I believe that like the those funds shouldn't be reduced. I agree with you on that but I think we should put more money into finding alternatives until a point like and just working towards, it's not an immediate solution.
0	Finding alternatives
0	Okay so what so so correct me if I'm wrong what you're trying to say is, we should put more money into finding better ways to um to better better contraceptives and better ways to use contra contraceptives.
1	And yeah
1	And eventually I think the long term costs of putting the money into there is eventually going to reduce the number of abortions. Uh
0	I mean so I I actually agree with that putting more money into it because what one thing that we should do is more sexual education, I feel like by increasing that you will have a uh a lower likelihood of abortions occuring.
1	Yeah I think there's like and the I agree and then like there's just a lot of new methods out there like I mean I don't know if you heard of but like Bill Gates and he's put a lot of money into finding like developing like the new condom and he uh he put out a prize I think it's $50,000 for uh someone to like have a new design for that and I think that's a really good idea you know finding something that works better and it's um, yeah and like the way they were they said it's like a lot cheaper the way they've been developing xxx
0	Finding something that works better and, doesn't take xxx
0	Because I feel like you uh the thing with the condom it's the same thing as a little kid trying to wear a helmet when he's riding a bike. You don't want to do it because it you don't look as cool or whatever but I feel like with like that like that type of a thing would actually increase the increase using a contraceptive.
1	Exactly so I think that putting money into programs like that and putting money into post-pregnancy programs
0	I I agree I agree with you on that yeah but I but we shouldn't take away, reducing funds from Planned Parenthood like that I don't think that should do that should happen yeah.
1	But yeah re I don't think you should be reducing funds, no. I don't yeah I don't believe that we should do that. No yeah I agree.
0	So, abortion should be legal. Um funds should be increased in sexual education and contraceptive awareness. And um, I feel like contraceptives should be made more readily available.
1	Yeah and not just, and I yeah I mean not just condoms but I think like birth control um as well simply because, at the end of the day like if you look at it like a condom's like the guy choosing um and birth control is the female choosing so that's...I think it should be a choice.
0	Birth control is the female yeah I any any sort any sort of birth control whether it's uh a pill or a condom it should be more readily available. I mean I understand you have like brand names and stuff like that to make money but it should be made more readily available and the government should put more funding into that, and they I mean they do they do do quite a bit in that department which is a good thing but it's the education part that's lacking the most most likely.
1	Yeah no
1	And I agree and I think reducing, um I'm not necessarily like like like you know, we're not really taking away from the funds of abortion but putting money into there I feel like in the long run will simply just naturally reduce those costs, despite xxx
0	Exactly. It it's I feel like I feel like um if you just put more money into that sexual education and you get a and you find an approach that appeals to children and makes them actually pay attention and understand what's going on I feel like if you put money into that that would prevent more pregnancy teen pregnancies unwanted pregnancies and stuff like that.
1	And along those lines I think one thing that should possibly be a federally mandated standard for sexual education because I feel like in a lot of states um, I mean not in California too much but if you go to Texas it's like the answer is don't have sex you know $ that's the extent of, yeah. Exactly um so I think that
0	No not in Cal, yeah. Wh...yeah.
0	Where they just don't they don't they don't educate you as much yeah. I agree.
0	Like the that it should'nt it shouldn't it should no longer be a state issue it should be a federal issue.
1	It should be up to the states to decide. It definitely should. Especially if the federal, is the one right xxx court you know
0	Exactly yeah.
0	I agree with you on that it uh the way the sexual education should be federally mandated because that I feel would um, would educate a lot of people educate a lot more people and it would make them make them make make the rates of pregnancies go down.
1	And the children that they would be having aren't becoming necessarily states of citizens of the state they're becoming American citizens at least an American cost you know. It needs to be a federal issue.
0	Citizens yeah, yeah exactly.
0	I I agree. So what we have is legal legalize keep abortion legal
1	But increase funds for alternatives.
0	Increase funds for, uh alternatives or contraceptive awareness and sexual education. Mand federally mandate sexual education and um, what else do we have?
1	I think that's yeah I mean largely it like just, yeah like attempt to you reduce the costs of abortion through other methods you know like yeah but not make it illegalized.
