1	So how do you feel about gay marriage?
0	I think gay marriage should be um It should be like legal because it's like a human right to be able to get marriage like regardless of like like your your sexual preference like why did that matter like against like marriage you know so I think like they should be like gay marriage should be like legal
1	yeah me too um I personally grew up or still growing up in a very catholic family but I feel like um well they like their religion feels and I think that's has been a a big problem that religion feels that there shouldn't be gay marriage that marriage should be between a man and a woman but I personally feel that people should uh get married becasue they're happy if you're forced into thinking that you're getting married with a woman or a man because you're you that's what you've been taught I don't think that's right I think you should be married with someone that you feel comfortable with like that you're like okay well uh I 'm happy with this person I wanna be with this person so this is a person I'm gonna marry. Um like I said I've grown up in a family that is very religous but in my my mind I've thought I've thought whenever that get's brought up like um like I don't I don't wanna that's not my opinion that religion that's noprobably the only thing I'm against religion is that uh that I feel like peopl should have the right to be able to get married to with who they wanna get married with
0	yeah yeah I feel like it is [...] based on religion like like that you know it's not legal because you know because religion says like in the bible like well i don't know theinterpretation or whatever said that a man and a woman are supposed to be together so it's like but it's like if in school like in school religion and education is separate like you know you can't go why is why is it the um why is the [...] like the government of our society still like you know combined you konw that's why like you know we shouldn't just because like the bible says we shouldn't you know like that shouldn't be like a right like the way we do it you know like I agree like you know like if you're happy then you know you shouldn't marry someone like because you feel obligated because you know like man and a woman you know if your happy with a partner like the same like sex then its like you guys should have the right to get married
1	um yeah most definitely I feel like the problem that growing up is that a lot of we're so stuck in a genereation where we're kind of confused because our parents our generation has evolved so fast that our parents haven't been able to adapt to that and our parents grew up in a generation generation where they uh where they were taught that um man and woman and that's how the marriage should be you should have kids and that's how it should grow but um I feel like gay people don't really have a choice like I don't think they grow uh like they're born and they're like alright well I like girls and thenthe next day they're like I like boys I mean as a child you grow up and you don't really think about things but um I think in your mind and you miht say you are a since the day your born you already have that kind of idea of what you like and what you don't like like there's something that that that's not gonna change who your personality and people are like well I can go to I can go uh to a psychologist and they can change who I like I feel like at that point your not your not truly gay you're just confused of what you like because I feel like that's someone that is truly gay that they're not gonna change their mindset because of what someone tells tells them or kind of messes with their brain what they like and then because of that you're just kind of confused and but if you're truly like if you're truly gay and you're you're not gonna be able to change someone you're not gonna you they might feed you uh like feed back lik eoh so hpw are you feeling they're gonna be like well you know what I think I might like somebody else or I think I like men now uh like if a woman tells you that like if you go a woman walks into a psycho a psychologist and they tell them that then she's probably gonna be like well um this guy's telling me so much information that I just wanna kind of get him off my back so that that's what they're gonna tell them just to make them happy but I don't think you can really honestly change someone that is truly gay like okay
0	yeah yeah I'm pretty close I like I've never thought the same thing as like you know like why would you you know it's like you're you're gay or whatever like why would you if society tells you so much like you know you can be straight you know like if like men like men and woman or whatever then like why would you like you know it's so much easier just to be straight like because if you're like if you're gay like society completely like rejects you so it's like why would you know why would you choose to be gay because society is gonna reject you and all this you know it's like you don't choose it it's like you know it's just who you are so it's like because like why are we like you know like yeah like giving like taking away that righ to someone like that's who they are you know like we should like complete accept them but you don't accept them it's like I feel too like that um it it's just like like human right just to be able to get married you know why why are we telling them no you can't get married because you're gay like that just doesn't seem right like it just like we're discriminating against them like you know what happened that's like it's kind of like um I don't know I don't feel like it's right like you you just because you know what what like the you you have this like you're like you're gay that doesn't mean like you shouldn't be able to get married like that um
1	yeah I feel like the like the U.S. in general maybe not just a there are states where they're they are more lenient about it but I feel like the U.S. in general though the U.S. is pretty like like bad about it like they don't want to accept that people are gay like it happens people are gay like you can't change that you're not gonna be able to change someone so that I feel like the U.S. kind of neglects people that are gay and it kind of puts down so whenever you see like a a gay couple like you instinct is not because you don't you're no like you don't accept gay people because of how society has set it up like you're kind of like whoa they're kind of gay i don't know like you're kind of like you kind of second thought them and if you see a straight couple like a man and a woman then you're noit gonna second thought them you're gonna just think it's normal but I think as a society and like other generation that we grew up think uh everyone telling us oh gay people are bad like you can't do that like uh you need to like a girl and then you're like man and the way we were taught is now that we're older it's kind of harder to comprehend uh like a gay relationship and it's really gonna come down to your personality and if you're willing to accept that because people like like I have a lot of friends that like they're like oh I can't believe you did you see that dude like they're gay like I can't believe they're holding hands I'm like well like you're kind of like being like you're kind of neglecting them because of becasue of who they like like It's like even if in a straight marriage like like say you like somebody and they're like oh I can't believe you're dating her like you're still gonna be like well it's the preson I like and it's the same thing with gay marriage like if you like somebody you're not gonna be able to not like them because of who they are like I think it goes further than just the like uh like the relationship it goes more into the personality of one person like they have to kind of be able to accept them and if you can't then I feel like it has come down to a lot where it's how you were raised because your parents told you so much and they kind of like closed mind you
0	yeah yeah like I guess like you know the U.S. is closed minded like you said yeah I don't know but it's like I kinda feel like that like who are we to say what's right and what's wrong like you know why why is it a law you know that it's like gay people can't get married who are we to say that? and like how is that like like how is that like morally right you know just because like we think like cause like because of you know our society you know we think like oh this is how it's supposed to be but like is it really like that like you know like so we're basically saying like we can discriminate against you all these like these people is kind of like like that's and like I don't think that's right like you know like you know I feel like we should be more open minded you know as a like a whole society and but I think it is like based on like how our parents you know like raised us how we grew up like what we're taught in society like there's a like um before in the 1970's when
