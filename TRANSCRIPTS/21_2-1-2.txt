1	Okay so um oh marijuana um what is your opinion about it like in general what do you think about it like the legal rights? what do you thinks going to happen like if that happened they actually legalized it?
0	If they were to actually legalize it I think um everybody would just like um to like, not everybody would but people who want to use it like teenagers mostly and young people like college students only use it I think that they like rush to the option and going to
1	exactly like everyone would want to use it right? like not medically so much but like for their use um so what do you think about it like if there was like more like those people who actually need it like medical wise would you like still agree with that?
0	um I think if it's for medidical purposes then I think it's more acceptable but
1	It's still like to like you just don't know if they actually need it yeah for [...] do you think more um like youths are going to take advantage of it then like people who actually like people who don't are going to take more advantage of it, me too
0	yeah I think
0	well from where I'm from that's like like um I guess you could say the norm like it's um like it's wide spread like everybody um around that area is because it's around [venices] sometimes the beach around there like there's like shops everywhere like you walk and there's like shops and just like people advertising it and it's like people dressed up in like all green and there like highlighter green and there like carrying signs and stuff and then um I don't think there that many people who need medical marijuana like for them to advertise it that vigoriously
1	yeah it's it's more um like people are like rooting for it but not so much because they they know that there's some people who actually need it medically but they're rooting for it for their own benefits
0	oh okay um to convince someone to legalize it I'm not sure what like what to say you know I'm trying to think of something but I can't really
1	there's like no
0	well for me that in fact in the perspective of someone that would want it I can't like really picture
1	like why like it's not that important to fight for someone to have it and because I mean there's like other medications we can take like
0	yeah and if it it's more than they should they have the medical card so like
1	but it's not necessary to actually have a marijuana
0	yeah for like everybody for the public
1	like there's other medications you can take
1	to cover
0	and like just in heart you meant that their excuse like it relaxes your [..] because for college student it's relaxing
1	it sounds a lot like an excuse to get high
0	i guess an argument could be it's relaxing and
1	and it comes with that
0	it comes with that
1	it comes with [easing] i don't know
0	easing stress or something
1	easing stress
1	um do you think it would get like kind of out of hand though if you legalized it?
0	i think so like at first i think there would be like i don't want to say an out brak but i think just like the use of it would just rise so much and I think people that don't use it because it's accessible then it's just going to spread
0	and it's like it's not legal so people are like oh I don't want to do it it's not legal but now legal so it's like
1	may be i should try it
0	yeah maybe I should try it it's not that bad if like people say it should be legalized then maybe it's acceptable for me to use it
1	um do think it would like um oh yeah well we yeah just discussed it like influence other people who don't really know much about it but they think oh well my friends are doing it you know they're trying it so maybe I should try it
0	yeah it's just like peer pressure so it like being asked to do that
1	so what would you like um let's say like someone who wants it ... would you say there's no excuse like there's other stuff you can take or what would you say?
0	yeah [because they already though of everything for our cause] [..] cancer cells
1	um and then there's like other stuff you can do like to for example like relax like you don't have to necessarily take medication or even take marijuana like you can do um you know what for example? there's a lot
0	I just though of one some people say it's um natural like it grows so it's not like as bad as cigarettes so i guess um an argument could be um the lesser [two evils] so that people like you can run [out of cigarettes] smoking will decrease or somthing like that potential i guess
1	haha [...]
0	[..] the purpose of legalizing it
1	and then for like example let's just say like um like if someone who's like who has the the card right whose already using it like would it be different like if everyone wait so they if they legalize it then then everyone can grow it or?
0	um I'm not sure i think its i think it thats one of the aspects of legalizing it
1	oh okay
1	well that can be a problem ha
0	um kind of like another one if people grow it then they um likely become business like stimulate the economy in some way
1	like that would be like a up for being legalized
0	so um smaller businesses that are like just people put more money in people who put more money in to it i guess that's another um pro for legalizing it
1	more businesses haha
1	let's just say like um it would be okay for it to be legalized like in the united states or just like in certain states
1	because if it's like for example let's say they legalize it in only in california that could be a problem for other states because people can just come here and get some and go back
0	i think in colorado or somewhere
0	i think so yeah
