0	Well I personally do not believe in um gay and lesbian, you know, marriage. Because, it is probably because of my religious beliefs. I am Christian so I do I do not um I do not have anything against gay or lesbians, and I do not criticize them or you know I do not boo at them or anything you know, but I I do not support it. You know? So yeah, haha.
1	Is that is it because like you say because I am Catholic too, so is it because like since gay and lesbians cannot actually have babies with each other, is that why?
0	Uh, I think it is more because well, first of all I believe in the Bible. And so you know it says that that is not accepted, you know in the Bible. For a a two women to married or two men to get married, so that is one of the reasons I do not support it.
1	Yeah. So do you see the Bible as like as um, because I I I am for it, that is why um because I do not see the difference if they are attracted to each other and they do want to get married, and like there it would be the same thing as I guess allowing them to date or allowing them to do whatever because like they are still like people that have rights it is like you are kind of taking away something that
0	Yeah I like I said I do not I do not criticize them like you know, like you said they are humans and they have rights and and especially in this country you know where there is free will and and the government and no one can tell you what to do um I however you do have to respect the law you know but I, on my opinion, I do not support it, you know what I mean? Like I am entitled to have an opinion too, so yeah they they have their own life and they they can live their life as they please, but me personally I do not applaud them, I do not support them, you know what I mean? Like I am not going to go hold like these paper say and “I do not like you!” Haha, you know what I mean but No, I do not support it either.
1	So is your only reason because the Bible says?
0	Um, it is also because you know my customs, you know? The way I grew up, I grew up believing that marriage should be between a man and a woman, you know? And I guess that has a lot to do with what I believe, you know, the way that you are raised and what your parents um tell you, you know? What you are you have seen, what you have experienced and that has shaped me, you know? Versus Nature versus nurture kind of thing, you know? So yeah.
1	Yeah oh yeah, well I do not know I guess we are just supposed to be talking about how we disagree, but um I do not know I I like just totally disagree with that because like I feel like regardless of the way your parents like bring you up like I feel like not believe or not wanting to vote for them to get married would be like I do I do not know I feel like it would be taking away something that that it is not like our right to take away from them. Because like obviously we would be voting for this or for it or it against it, and so like I just feel like it is like putting myself in a position where or like putting someone else in a position where we are saying this is right and this is not right, so because I think this is right or I think this is wrong, we are going to take it away. You know? Because I feel I do not know I feel like well we are essentially doing is taking away something that they could have had. We are not really giving them anything, you know? Anything more than what we are than what we people like male and female couples already have.
0	Yeah I I do understand your position and I know where you are coming from, however like it would come to voting for that, which has happened in some states and some states do allow them to get married, you know, and if you asked me “Would I vote for them to get married?” I wouldn’t, you know personally. Because, I mean that is my personally vote, you know? And just like we are allowed to choose our our candidates and our representatives, I am allowed to say whether I I would like that to happen in this country or not, since I am part of that country. Um so my personal vote would be no I would I would not support it. You know and yeah, haha!
1	Yeah. Though yeah I understand we have different opinions about it I do not know what else we are supposed to talk about haha!
0	Yeah I think it is also you know and I I think it it has a lot to do with uh our culture. Like, I know different cultures have different opinions about gay and lesbian marriage, you know and and there are some cultures that actually honor those um those marriages, you know what I mean. And and they applaud them. And uh I guess uh here in in America we we just have not seen that a lot you know what I mean? It is just starting to come up um more openly and and that is probably why it has to do with um with the fact that some states are totally against it and and others who are more liberal more for it, you know what I mean? But yeah I mean, you are entitled to your own opinion and, I personally just would not support it. That is all, haha.
1	Yeah yeah another reason why I do support it is because like even like the way other people who are against it like I am not saying you, but like a lot of like maybe like um like the southern states and stuff, like they are like so like bashing and like very like very anti-gay, and just like I feel like it is so hurtful, so like in that like yes versus no it kind of like divides people into like “Oh my gosh! They are anti-gay and they are they are so full of hate!” And blah blah blah. And so like even though I am not saying like I am like you know people who are for it are totally great people, and people who are against it are like right-wing or whatever. But it is just like I just feel like I it adds like a negative stigma also, to like be against it, because I do not know It is just like I just feel it is a whole bunch of negativity that that goes with it.
0	I I totally agree with you! Yeah, no and I totally agree with you, and the fact that there should not be any hatred, you know what I mean? The fact that I do not agree with what you are what other people are doing, you know? The fact that we are disagreeing on this, this does not mean that I am going to hate you or or vice versa, you know what I mean? It just means that we have different opinions and different ways to see our lives, but I do totally oppose people who are who are you know um punishing these people physically, you know what I mean? Or or or mentally or uh any psychologically, you know what I mean like? If they because some of these are um, you know they are hatred groups and all that and I I do not I do not approve that either, you know what I mean that is why I am saying like I am not going to go tell them “I hate you!” but I I do not support it either, kind of thing. Do you know what I mean? Does that make sense? Yeah okay yeah yeah.
1	Yeah yeah yeah no I agree I mean like I understand what you are saying, but Um Haha!
0	And you are right like there have been a lot of um um gay people who because they have been bullied at school or or their social places, you know, they they go and kill themselves. And that is horrible, you know I do not think that is right either I do not think that that because you disagree with what someone believes or wants in their life, that you have the right to go and tell them “Oh you are wrong” you know “You are sick” or “you are this or that” you know what I mean? You should not be pushing that person to feel so bad to the extreme or taking their own lives, you know what I mean? I do not agree with that either, so
1	Do you think there is like a difference between like the segregations like before like in the like 50s and 60s versus like them not allowing people uh gays to get married now, like maybe like
