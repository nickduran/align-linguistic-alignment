1	ok so I said yes because it will help those who actually need it and then those who do not need it I feel like it will decrease the rates actually those who uh do not need it who are smoking it because now of course like everyone knows a lot of people smoke it so a lot of people like who do not need it I mean smoke it and I feel like if if it is legal then I feel like people like it so much because it is illegal they kind of like the like badness of it I I mean that is what I feel like and I feel like if it is uh legal it will just like it will kind of like it might like go like a hype for like a month or something and I feel like after that it will just kind of turn boring to people because it will be like something that they are allowed to do
0	* yeah
0	* yeah
0	but like for that point if that is the case like then but there is like if you go drinking is legal and people who still are legally able to drink they still drink it you know? because even though you know I understand you said it might go down but then what if it does not go down? and another thing is if even if that goes down because there into it because it is like bad and it is illegal and they are into that there is like a lot of other drugs that they can turn to you know? that is like bad and legal
1	yeah but I mean people have I mean people have already turned to those drugs like haha I do not feel like those are going to like stop it I am yeah I am saying even if it was legal there should be like regulations like alcohol like can not do that and drive and stuff like that but I mean I feel like if it is legal it will the rate of its use will go down
0	# haha yeah
0	but the issue with that is like if you regulate like how would you regulate marijuana you know? because like
1	I mean same way as alcohol
0	well is it is the age really going to be twenty one? it is like you can not smoke it until you are twenty one years old? or is it like haha
1	ok maybe not the age but like you can not smoke and drink and drive or like you will get tested or something like that or like you know like the the I do not know ok or like uh well there is other ones they could use like haha you uh or maybe like you just can not go over a certain amount or like I do not know I just feel like I I really feel like people are going to get bored with it because people get bored with things when they are like like it is accessible to them people like the that when things are like hard to get to or not like are illegal for them and not when there is restrictions on things they are more interesting when things are like oh yeah you can do it it is like oh you kind of just took the fun out of it
0	* yeah
0	# haha
0	# haha
0	but see then that is like yeah
0	* yeah
0	yeah but I mean the issue I think I guess the reason why they like haha do marijuana is because I do not know the little drug activity stuff you know? like it messes up your head and stuff something like that so basically it is like even if you like make it legal and then people get bored with it you know? like I'm saying you still have the other stuff you know it is not really cracking down on the issue into why they ban marijuana in the first place
1	# haha
1	well marijuana does not have any effects like other drugs does it is just like it is strictly a plant unless it is like laced with something like haha
0	well it effects
0	right but it does alter your mind though
1	only when you are high on it
0	yeah but what else did you
1	but I mean it is not like it just uh it does not make you like it is not like LSD or or bath salts it does not make you want to go eat someone it just like it makes you like I do not know like when people are on it they are like calm and like
0	# haha
0	but maybe that is the issue you know? maybe you are too calm I do not know
1	but then why do we make alcohol illegal because that makes you that alters your state of life too
0	it does but like haha at one point it was not I do not even know where I am going with this but I mean like yeah like you should it does alter your like state of mind or whatever but I guess they did try to make it illegal at once point but then I guess ultimately they figured that they can control it to a point where like it is not that harmful to society which marijuana may be they do not maybe they can not they have not figured out how they can control it and regulate it to the point where it will not hurt as many people you know?
1	# haha
1	I just feel like alcohol already it is like it has been scientifically proven that alcohol has worse effects on your body than weed does marijuana does and uh I mean I know that like when you are on it it definately does make you like not normal like you are not in your normal presence but I mean alcohol does it is different I mean like I know the effects are different I do not know to what extent but I know that uh when you are I mean they both they both uh alter your state of presence though I mean if one is legal then the other one should be legal and one is illegal then the other should be illegal if it is alcohol is legal then weed should be too
0	# haha
0	* yeah haha
0	* yeah
0	I think with alcohol it is like they know what like beacuse if you are drunk there is like there is ways to tell if you are drunk like if you are high who knows like like who knows what are the give away signals to you being high?
1	* haha that is true
1	# haha
1	I mean there is like red eyes but then people can use eye drops oh I am now going on the other side uh haha my side my side my side
1	well you can tell when people
0	well people could just be like you know I have that one that eye disease that one thing that is why my eyes are red you know
1	but police like if there is uh indication then they could just like I mean you can always tell when people are drunk some people are really good at hiding that
0	well they have the little breathalizer thing
1	they can have they have brethalizers for weed yeah they were doing it in uh I can not remember now but I know they were like they were like busting people for it
0	do they?
0	but do like so but what was their like legal limit? or what was the limit that they were like this is safe to
1	I am not sure
1	haha I do not know I do not know that
0	haha oh ok I guess then that is another thing that you are going to have to figure out like with marijuana like which is the safe like safe to where you can be able to function you know driving and stuff like that? because do you you have to figure that out
1	yeah but I mean like they do that with alcohol
0	but see alcohol is more a clear thing like if you drink a little bit like people can like drink and below legal limit and they drive you know? with marijuana like
1	well I feel like alcohol and marijuana are not that different because I mean alcohol if someone drinks this much alcohol it might have like one effect on this person but a different effect on this person and with marijuana I feel like it is kind of the same thing like different people have different effects on it I mean they are both like drugs so haha
0	yeah but with alcohol like yeah also it does have different effects on people because it depends on like your weight and stuff like that but there is still able to be a standard to where it can be like this is the legal limit
1	you could do that with marijuana too though like if you smoke over this much they are going to pass out like you know
0	but I do not mean maybe there is not as much
0	but maybe there is not as much research into like the marijuana thing to where you can come up with those standards and then
1	I feel like there is I mean why else would colorado make it legal?
0	well because it is like
0	well I mean if because other like the government like everyone do it you know if there was a standard was like yeah this is all legal you know you can have this much marijuana in your system you know? because more states would do it and
1	* yeah
