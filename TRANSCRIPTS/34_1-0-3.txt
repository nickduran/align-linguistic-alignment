0	I think that I I disagree I don't think that it should be legal because a person is a person at conception and I mean if it like you said if it's a hard time for the woman um even though it is her body I think other options there's adoption um or just you know uh trying harder to to try to make it for the baby and um um in the case of rape I I mean that's obviously a very tough situation that somebody would be in but um like I said again there's other options. I don't know I don't feel like because something bad happened to you it's okay to take somebody else's life.
1	I if you have like uh a woman uh got pregnant at a very young age they don't have ability to take care of take care of children and um they will have a lot of responsibility um I also xxx children they don't have like a good family
0	yeah. I think that if somebody's been even if they feel like they're responsible enough to have sex than we should be responsible enough to deal with the consequences.
1	okay I just I'll just say if they got like like rape than that's not their choice
0	if they got raped
0	right? It's not but they can still give the baby up for adoption . Um in the case of if it's it's a woman's body if she doesn't want the baby she should be able and like discard it um I don't I don't really agree with that because it's like how do you put a limit I mean where would the limit be so if if somebody is pregnant and they have an abortion than a few months later they get pregnant again then they have another abortion like or you know is there supposed to be a limit on that or? Um it's not a form of birth control I guess is what I'm trying to say
1	um like the case in China um you know for the birth limit for like all the families are allowed to have 1 children and they're allowed to do abortion any time if they no want yeah kind of like birth control but it w it works like now uh like solve a lot of problems for family and womens like women uh get pregnant before marrying and they can do abortion to like so they can make their life easier not to have a baby so they maybe won't have a good future for the baby.
0	yeah. Um I I mean if somebody is worried about getting pregnant before you get married then they shouldn't be having sex before they're married either. I think it's just a matter of responsiblity um this is something that I feel pretty strongly about because it's I mean it's technically murder you're murdering a child because it's going to make your life difficult I don't think that's fair.
1	it's also making the children's life difficult
0	but that was you know the the mother's choice or the parent's choice when they if they knew that they couldn't provide for a baby then they shouldn't be doing something that can make the baby.
1	but that's not only the woman's like responsibility also for man's
0	of course. I I understand like in China it's a different situation because like you said the birth limit but here you know it's not um it's not really relevant because there's a lot of people out there that can't have children and who would be you know willing to adopt and take care of a child um and also if somebody gets pregnant here in the United States and they're not in a position to you know take financial support of the child there's a lot of help that our government that our country gives to people that um so um there's so many different things that somebody could do rather than abort them. Here anyway
1	okay. I still think that's a personal choice so
0	I mean you're right it is a personal choice it is your choice whether or not you want to do it but it still that doesn't make it right. I don't think so um
0	I knew that uh somebody really close to me wanted wanted to have an abortion and after a a little bit of thought she decided not to and now I know that child and she's so beautiful and I love her and I can't imagine like if if she would've never been in my life how that how much different it would've been for everybody involved so that's my personal experience that I have with it and also the people who do get abortions after they feel guilty I mean they live with that for a long time um rather than them ending up having the baby and the baby giving it another opportunity with another family who are capable
1	. I do know people who have thought about it that they think differently so maybe some for some people they think um they shouldn't have that baby in their life so they can do something else when they have the ability to have a baby they will like let that happen but it would be good for children
