0	Okay how old are you?
1	I'm 20.
0	You're not 21 yet.
1	I'm not 21.
0	I'm 18. So how do you feel about illegal drinking?
1	Um I have like mixed feelings about it. Uh I think like the main thing that concerns me is that your brain isn't fully developed till you're about 25 and I know that alcohol affects just like your overall like I don't know health and development. So um that's the only thing I actually think uh it's good that it's at 21, the age is at 21, but um I don't know I think over in other countries they have it at 18 and I think that's actually worked out better for them.
0	Oh. I think you should be 18 up to drink. And the reason I say that is because like you're 18 and you're able to do everything else. Like you're legal enough to go to clubs when you're 18. You're legal enough to buy cigarettes, and like cigarettes can hurt you too cigarettes give you cancer. So if you do that you should be able to drink too. S
1	That's true. Yeah. Um I think one thing too is that if you make it sort of like this bad thing like oh you shouldn't do this until you're 21, then when you're like 16 you're like oh I want to do this bad thing so it sort of has a negative effect and it makes you want to do it more. Um when it's like not like they make it less of a big deal in other countries and it seems to actually cause them to not want to binge drink as much and um so just maybe like drink a little bit more regularly, but not as much when they drink. Which is actually healthier so.
0	Maybe they think that but maybe they think that being 21 up should be the legal age just because people turn into alcoholics but either way you're going to turn into an alcoholic even if you're 18. So and then like people go to parties high school college parties and they can drink beer and they're like 17 18 and like nobody is like oh you shouldn't be drinking this like everybody's going to have a good time andf drink either way.
1	Yeah I mean that's true. It's gonna happen either way basically. Um yeah no that's definitely true. I feel like they do that I don't even know why it's messed up. $ Uh yeah
0	I think they think because you're like 21 that you're more mature. But there's people who are 21 that do like the most childish things. Man like people who are 21 like drink and then go ahead and drive, and even if you're like 18 doesn't mean you're going to do the same thing. There are people probably 18 that get a designated driver.
1	Yeah that's definitely true. I think that's their main reason it's like you're probably going to be more mature by the time you're 21. Um I'm almost 21 and I definitely feel like I've changed drastically since I was 18, but like regarding alcohol I still think I would make the same decisions like you're saying like I would still get a sober driver, a DD, um I don't think my opinions about that have really changed at all.
0	. Um what else oh we can go to hookah bars um
1	Yeah it seems silly you can do everything except for drink and it's just like why and I think that like going back to that though it makes this thing that's like you really want it, and it's like this illegal thing but it's like well god why can't it be like everybody else so it makes you really want to do it and
0	And there's no like strict strict rules on it like you can't just be 18 and go ahead and go to the store and be like okay I want to buy this and like they can reject you from buying it but you can also go outside and give somebody money who is of age and they'll go ahead and buy it for you. My friend did that.
1	Yeah it's like so easy to get by it. Yeah, or like fake IDs all that.
0	Yeah oh and my other friend has a fake ID.
1	Yeah you can get fake IDs online $ Yeah it's like too easy to beat the system um so it's pointless. Yeah they should like I don't know that's the only thing I was sort of bringing up I was like playing devil's advocate is the brain's development like I feel like it affects the brain development since you're not fully developed by 25. But um yeah that's probably whatever.
0	*$ for real
0	*That's crazy
0	Exactly so they should just lower the age*
0	No matter like there's I don't know some people do illegal drugs like coke and heroine and stuff and they're not 21 or they're probably 21 either way they're going to mess up their brain.
1	Yeah. Yeah thats definitely true. I feel like the like prison system has something to do with it too like they probably make money off like getting kids in trouble for alcohol like I don't know or they I don't know much about it but I feel like there's something involved there that they probably want like like you know you get a drinking in public ticket you got to pay for that they probably enjoy like you know making kids pay for drinking in public or like underage drinking I don't know.
0	Yeah my friend got a ticket for being drunk in front of a police officer.
1	Yeah that'll happen $ uh yeah well no and in Europe they give their kids watered down wine when like yeah yeah it's really not as big of a deal over there its just sort of like um you know its just like not as big of a deal its like less of a concern not as much of a concern
0	Yeah $ she's silly*
0	Yeah and then they give babies whiskey when they're teething*
0	So the age should be lowered high five air high five
1	Yeah I definitely think it should uh $ um yeah it seems like America is really strict about some rules
0	And you can get married at 18. It's not like you can get married at 21 up. You can get married at 18 exactly risk your life get pregnant all those things
1	Well it's like you can go to the army too. You can like risk your life yeah and then when you are a part of the army you can drink too I think when you're 18 you can drink I could be wrong but yeah its like when you're in a different country you're abiding by their rules so you can drink yeah so it just seems yeah silly what are they doing? $ yeah yeah its just like another rule that you have to follow um yup drinking
0	that's crazy*
0	yeah because the age changes, true*
0	america trying to have their own rules*
0	$ when you were 18 did you drink at parties? wait did you party a lot?
1	$ I did drink uh I had a drink before I was obviously 21 so yeah I've definitely drank.
0	Go to parties a lot?
1	I'm trying to like $ yeah isn't that silly though like you're going to college and the drinking age is 21 it's going to be all around you so you're going to be extremely tempting you're most likely going to be 18 when you go to college so it's really just pointless to make it
0	Oh we all go to parties we're in college*
0	It's around you everywhere*
0	You just got to say yes or no to like peer pressure like when your friends are like drink drink drink and then you just got to know your limit
1	Yeah if they lowered it to 18 it might make you more responsible uh like quicker might make you realize like oh I have to take responsibility a lot faster um it could have a positive effect.
0	True. I got like super drunk one time at a party and then like I fell and like scraped my leg right here I still got the scars it was all bad and then my friend tried to carry me she's like your height and she tried to carry me I was like ooh and I started crying and laughing at the same time cause I just didn't know my limit and then I was just like forget it I didn't care that night but now I'm like um I can't get that sloppy drunk
1	Yeah so if you're introduced to it at a younger age then you're going to learn your limit a lot faster and I guess that goes with being responsible at a younger age so
0	You keep doing something for so long it's like okay it's not even like going to hit you as much
1	Yeah yeah it's less of this like forbidden treasure. It's like I'm trying to get wasted $ whereas it's like I'm just trying to drink beer because it's not that big of a deal
0	$ white boy wasted*
0	Yeah people think that beer compared to alcohol is like not that much but beer still gives you the same feeling especially if you're not used to it.
1	Yeah definitely um there's a lot yeah I think your whole psychological view on it would
