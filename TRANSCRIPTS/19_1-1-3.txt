1	pro choice #
0	against it. #
1	okay. what were you thinking about. do you remember that time they were here at the school with like a bunch of posters of like dead fetuses and dead whatever?
0	oh yeah I remember those.
1	that was great. sorry I just had to remember that because I was just like great there is a tour of your little kids coming up here you guys had better take that shit down! # yeah.
0	yeah but definitely got its point across though.
1	I mean I I I literally just walked past it because I was late for class but I was kind of like this is ridiculous. I I think I mean personally I am pro choice because I do not think like the should not have that choice at like I I personally I do not like abortion and how do I explain this but if it like was in a situation where like a girl was raped I want that choice out there.
0	well if they were raped I can kind of understand why it would be a possible choice but
1	yeah like I am all for choice even though I personally do not want like abortion. I am going to just put that disclaimer out there. # but I just want that choice out there because I do not think it should be up to anyone but the person carrying whatever.
0	so question you yourself would you have an abortion? because I do not think this question would apply towards me. #
1	yeah I was going to say you probably would not # know but like okay well at least me in the situation if I got pregnant because of being careless I would not have an abortion but if it was being pregnant because of rape then I probably would. but honestly if I was ever put in that position like in that situation I know I do not know what my mind would go through.
0	would you have an abortion?
0	#but I have heard
0	yeah. well I also heard that there was like complications like if you do have an abortion like it could actually affect whether or not you could have children in the future. so if you were like
1	yeah but see that is that choice. like you need to know all your pros and cons to it. but I do not want you to be like completely off from that like choice if you just you know wanted it. and to be honest if you did not have a choice to and you had to have a kid and you could not take care of it imagine how much that child has to go through. #
0	well damn that is pretty hard.
1	yeah like their development. they would just go through a lot of shit.
0	but in the end if you do not even allow that person to live like there has been many children that have been like um given to adoption agencies that have been able to grow up to be successful.
1	yeah also many that have shitty families and it affects
0	well it kind of depends. like the term it kind of depends can apply for anything really. yeah.
1	it does depend. that is why like you
1	that is why I was like I just I do not think it should be just illegal it should just have that choice as long as that person knowns all of their options like pros and cons and whether or not they should like what is going to happen if you know if and this happens your options are oh you can have it but you can also put it up for adoption but it is just that choice. to be there.
0	the choice itself is something that is everyone pretty much likes to have but I do not know we live in america where it does seem like we have a lot of choices right? but do we really have that many # choices?
1	no no # I I do not want to say we have a lot a lot of choices. but we do have more than others. put that way.
0	well we do have more than others but overall I kind of think that we have more restrictions to the point where it is not as bad as like in china where there is a lot of things that are kind of censored like the internet like you know that game Diablo three right? that is not even allowed in china for some reason.
1	a lot of things are not allowed in okay yeah. #
0	yeah like censorship in general is just bad.
1	yeah I guess I do not with them that stuff but most definitely I am pro choice. I do not know it is because I am a woman but like I said if I was ever put in that position I would not know what I would do. because I would not know but like for right now I would probably say if I was if it was a rape situation I would probably abort it because it should not have happened in the first place. but if it was like my mistake then I would face my consequences.
0	would not know what to choose?
0	uh I can personally accept that answer.
1	yeah so that is my opinion on that.
0	this topic has a lot of like
1	yeah it is a very very #
0	my side requires lots of graphs and pictures and this is uh two months three months and whatnot yeah.
1	oh trust me I already went to the ontology and I already seen it. I have done reports on the embryonic development and I still stand where I stand. because in the end that thing does not stay an embryo it becomes a human being. and I am really like I really like I I still like if you were not teen mom for example. If # you are not like ready to raise a kid can you imagine what those children are going through like in teen mom? like okay honestly okay it is a good show oh and they are making money on it at what not. I think the what is with the child's development though like if that poor kid living in a scripted life. it is really going to affect that poor poor thing.
0	which which class?
0	like those MTV shows? I do not like those shows.
0	well it is only for about like the first year of its life really which it does kind affect kind of like how it develops.
1	still it is it is one of the main main points of its life #. so that is why I just like I do not you are not going to do it. I remember oh and another reason is because like um I remember hearing about a story about um a lady going into an abortion clinic and there were protestors out there and then her husband was recording and he was telling them how the baby had like a one in a million chance of living because she was going to give birth to a stillborn. so in that situation I do not think she would want to go through nine months of attachment to give birth to a yeah. . and that was like that really put me on the whole yeah definitely pro choice now because that is that is emotional like that is emotional like devastating. you try carrying a child # in your stomach!
0	nine months of a child that most likely will not like survive?
0	I can carry one just put it inside my shirt and pretend. # I do not think that counts.
1	# you know! just a little child. no. yeah it is it is it is going to be pretty emotional. I know like there is like faith out there like you know that one in a million chance you want that child to be you one in a million chance but it is very slim and if I had that choice then I would probably have to abort because I would not want to even like try I would still abort. and after that and even if it is all like even if it is going to affect my my um uh my chance of having birth later the fact that I had that gene that is going to have like the that is going to keep giving me this like gene that chance of giving birth to keep giving birth to stillborns I would just go adopt a kid. I would not just keep trying to have one when I know I should not. it is all just like choices and knowing your pros and cons.
0	yeah you just like having the choice of selecting whether or not you want to.
1	. and you are yeah you are right like we are we do not have that many things in america. this is just one more thing that we can have. a choice.
0	it is eight minutes is almost up. #
1	right? # can not drag this on any longer! I am just going to bring up stories!
0	oh god! #
1	alright so yeah about that little abortion thing out on school! #
0	I am not going to lie I kind of just walked past it and that is like okay.
1	yeah I walked right past it then I was like wow that is great. you know the first thing you see is you know all that stuff it is like seen it everywhere. I know I have I have this whole like I heart life sticker and it was not anti abortion sticker I just I just liked it because a little bear saying I heart life. Like I just love life in general. # I like life in general!
0	I wonder if I heart life actually like goes for abortion then. would not I heart life actually go for abortion then?
1	I am sorry it was pro abortion. or no it was anti abortion.
0	would not it be pro abortion though if you want life because then you actually like promote the child to actually continue like growing.
1	that is anti abortion. abortion is killing a kid. right?
0	yeah I think that is #
1	yeah so it is anti abortion it is an anti abortion sticker. and I am like my laptop it was just you know it was a bear holding a sign that said I heart life and that was really cute. but I am still pro choice.
0	was it mainly just the bear or was it the heart like him holding the heart that #.
1	It was # hey I just love life in general because I am holding it and I am having fun but you know. I still do not think people should be in this life if their parents were not ready to do it. to raise them I want to stick with that. I do not know what else to say right now but I think I already
