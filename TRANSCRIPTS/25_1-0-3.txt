0	Your views on the death penalty?
1	I was debating on this also but I said it is cruel and unusual
0	Why is that?
1	Because dude I look I like I have like dude I am still debating right now because I do not know wheather it is good or bad though but like it is just cruel and unusual because wait like is it because they killed someone or just any crime
0	Well well I think the death penalty would only be related that was. yeah and um
1	What do you think?
0	What I what would I say?
1	Is it.
0	Death the death
1	Because I am going for a yes right now it is.
0	Death penalty as I see it is I see a yes. If you commited the crime some heinous crime
1	like killing people like oh okay
0	like killing people like like like or some crazy psycho murderer they they should they know what they are doing it is premeditated they plan it out they know what they are doing they know the difference between right and wrong and they are going to get away with it? They are going to be sitting in jail for 25 30 years and
1	That is that is only wait it is not for like lifetime?
0	Death penalty? They they sit there like like
1	Well no no I meant like like if they go to jail would it be like life time?
0	Well yea but at the same time you have to take into account like the money spent to keep them or like
1	Food costs like water costs
0	All of that when they they should not deserve to be haha to be around if they are if they are doing something wrong so mean and it unusual to a person like why is it okay for them to live when they took the life of someone innocent?
1	Probably even more people like yeah. Okay I okay yea I cause like I was not sure about I had questions in my head but I agree with you
0	Okay like and in like in plenty of places for example if you could offer like you could cut off a wrist if someone steals and that like and the stealing. Well if someone is going to kill someone why do you not kill them as well? Like I know that like we are more of a developed country but at the same time we have so many murderers we have so many people out there that are like it is ok I am just going to go to jail Iike I will be like on death row for plenty of years like I do not have to really worry about it like I will still get food I will still get all of this like I feel someone
1	yeah I know
1	oh yeah
1	they get like food free healthcare too at the prison. yeah I know still
0	why like they do not deserve that they do not deserve all of those benefits if they did a crime that was so mean and harmful to someone who is innocent i mean there are like I
1	so like do you like think it is messed up though is it like cruelwise is it cruel to like
0	Honestly death I would see as rather painless in many aspects especially with lethal injection like that happens within a minute um it could be cruel and unusual but
1	#have you seen like okay like electric chair
0	yeah but that is like pretty much gone or like the shot where they line up lots of people and they shoot them. but that would also be it would go quite quickly. so cruel and unusual would be
1	y god
1	like where would they shoot them though?
0	like they line up a row of people and one person has likr actual um bullets and eveyone does not and they all pretend to shoot or they all shoot and end up shooting the other person and that is pretty instantaneous but at the same time they do not like
1	have you researched this before?
0	i just know about that topic
1	wow i do not know anything about this
0	there is an electric chair there is lethal injection there is that and then there is one other form
1	oh, but how many states do they like do this in?
0	most of the time it is lethal injection
1	oh, okay, and like the states that do allow it?
0	some of them still do the shooting but at the same time it is not like not that they are going through lots of pain or it is not llike we are hitting them and pushing them sometimes they do deserve cruel and unusual punishment but because of their crimes but i am not saying that we should do that i am saying they deserve it but not that we should not just thnk they shoud get to live life if they take yeah the only time i would seem it see it as like okay as if it were someone was like dying and they asked like to be put out of their misery
1	#because yeah
1	life away, yeah
1	like if they are on a bed of a hospital or something
0	yeah like if they are dying say they are dying of cancer or say that is is like completely incurable like then i would see say that mercy kill to be okay to be like
1	like i think doctors get that consent though
0	they are not allowed to do that it is illegal to do a mercy kill
1	see i did not know that
0	yeah it is illegal to do um because people can still get in trouble people can get like the death penalty or death rule for doing a mercy kill yeah but most of the time juries are okay like they see they find that like people were suffering so you know but other than that other than a mercy kill there is no reason to like kill people
1	like no that because the people said that they want to like pull the plug or something yeah but they can
0	yeah but people can get in trouble for mercy kills so i do not think it is fair if they went to jail when that is what the person wanted
1	did not know that
1	are there like times where doctors like do not pull the plug though just so they do not get caught?
0	um well i mean like pulling pulling the plug is like different than like a mercy kill like a mercy kill they can still like they still have time to live say is be like an extended period but they would be suffering the whole way through like for cancer they have um say they have pancreatic cancer you can not cure that that is uncurable like you can do radiation chemo but you can not take it out you can not do anything so they are going to be in so much pain so they tell someone kill me um just let me be out of my pain and misery
1	wait so like mercy kills?
0	that is a mercy kill
1	like they um oh inject them with something okay so what is pulling the plug then
0	they can inject them
0	pulling the plug is like when you can not when can not really like sustain life by yourself like you are on a say you are in like a coma or say you can not breathe by yourself that is like pulling the plug like they try to see if you can and if you can not um like they give your family options of pulling the plug or not yeah there is a difference
1	so, pulling the plug would that?
0	that would not that would not i do not think that would be classified as a mercy kill because they are seeing if you can sustain life by yourself but a mercy kill can get you in trouble
1	but pulling the plug can not?
1	that is weird
0	yeah well like i said like say they are like on a respirator or like what they are called and they pull that and you can not they want to see that if the person can breathe by themselves because that is what they want to do if they can not breathe they pass away because it is the machine keeping them alive but see with cancer like that is something else and that is how
1	yeah yeah
