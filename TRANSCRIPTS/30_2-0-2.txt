0	Alright so the topic we were given is gay marriage and okay personally I think that you know it's not even a matter of um really rights for another person to take away from another person you know there was even a whole seperation between church and state established way before the eighteen hundreds or the nineteen hundreds at least and that promise have stayed um um really strongly ever since um it's coming between um political machines um and the eighteen hundreds or late eighteen hundreds especially with [...] um where there's [...] um and I think it that's it's um a promise that should really be upheld because of that
1	upheld how?
0	okay because if your going to do it to one thing you have to keep it uniformed and keep it so that other social groups can be accepted or whatever it is that your talking about there has to be a seperation between the government and um private entities you know you can't have like a mixing between the two by private entities in this case I mean the church at least
1	the church
0	yeah you can't mix them both up even tho a lot of people try to make the argument that oh america was founded by god and it's through his graces that we're able to do you know that's their own beliefs but aside from that we had to write a constitution that protected the rights of every single individual and one of the interesting things about the constitution is that you basically the freedom you have the freedom to be yourself as long as you don't hurt other people or get in the way of other people's freedoms
1	and I think that when your gay you don't hurt anybody
0	well yeah just by being yourself I don't think you would hurt anyone but apparently you know it really throws some people off you know you have the [...] baptist church which actually comes on campus pretty often and they basically say oh soldiers die and um you know babies die on the other side of the world because their are gay people in america and they try to blame every single social issue and they also call them the anitchrist aside from like you know just the gay phoneticism they kind of do stuff like that so you know
1	I think that the church has a big influence on whether or not gay people should get married because I think the government is like out of the picture right now but when talk about gay people the church just come up and say oh god thinks that if your gay your going to hell and it's like a big controversal issue where there's people that want and know that there gay can't really express themselves because they think there going down the wrong path but they're not and it's it's sad that a lot of people can't be themselves
0	uh huh
0	yeah so yeah it's just really sad that you can't see two people together especially when I think it's in 21 you can marry some sort of animal you can you can marry a horse for example you can marry a freakin' horse
1	you can marry a horse
1	how is that better than two individuals
0	right and in this case you know hypothetically say if you marry pig your basically saying oh like you know gay marriage is beneath you know getting beneath getting beneath yeah a pig so it's worse than getting married to a literally a swine so that's
1	beneath an animal a [scavenger]
1	a swine
0	yeah so
1	I wish that one day I can get married and if I'm not aloud to I probably make the biggest fit out of it because it's my right to get married it's it's a controversal issue
0	ha ha
0	I feel like it is for a lot of people but it really shouldn't be I think most people as the generations goes on um you know there's a certain amount of [genderfication] that happens between the older generations all the way to the newer generatios so the newer generations become more liberal and conservatives you know as the [...] they tend to die and go away
1	I agree like uh relationships should be between two people and when it comes to being gay a lot of people like to include themselves in that relationship and they like to base their opinions and try to ruin their relationship but it's really not their business it's only suppose to be two people regardless if their the same gender or not
0	and that's what the definition really should be it's not the biblical definition of marriage but it should be what the constitutional definition of marriage is yeah cool glad we feel the same way
1	yeah ha ha we definitely do
0	yeah and I think that for other countries ^ yeah but I think that for other countries um in the for example the middle east my father is from the middle east for example and the way they're brought up it's not just um conservative for the sake being conservative it's because that's how their tradition is that ever since [A.D. seven hundred]um since when islam was created this became the culture of most middle eastern countries and they were taught to preserve what needs to be preserved and hung what needs to be preserved you know instead of moving towards pro gress even when they have moved towards progress quit a bit um they kind of got stuck in that thirld world country old world kind of view and that's really prevented them from making any sort of social progress whatsoever it just the culture it's not the just applied to gay marriage but other things such as capital punishment or whatever the issue may be um never the less you know that kind of thinking still needs to be erraticated even if it is part of their culture because I know that's the excuse that a lot people bring to the table they kind of say oh I was brought up to think this way I was brought up to think that way I know essentially you have your own you have your own mind you have your own way of thinking regardless of what your ancestors thought or what your even what your parents thought who you actually have an relationship with it shouldn't really matter because you're your own person
1	you have your own mind you have your own opinion
1	and your not going to change anything unless you do it and like how you said about keeping like conservative traditions and keeping them going it also comes down to marriage your suppose to marry the one you love and stick to that and they're not I feel like they're not keeping that tradition because when two people really love each other all everybody is trying to do is break them up and their not keeping their word so it's kind of you know throwing back at them
0	yeah and I think that um um in the same matter um that I guess a large portion I'm going to say a large portion because that's definitely not everyone of the christian or religious community can say oh you know god said this god said that well if you actually take a look at the bible yeah if you actually take a look that the bible your not aloud to wear more than um one different cloth at a time you know that's punishable by stoning which you know throw rocks at a person same thing if a man shall lay with another man their like oh a man should not lay with another man you know that's two different things from actually you know from maybe loving someone of the same gender as you know
1	i hear that everyday
1	yeah you know the I heard several places where the bible does state you like a man is suppose to be with a women but it never say their not allowed to it just says they're suppose to but you know it doesn't say oh your not suppose to do it so your going to hell like it's never said that hell has never been in the same sentence when it comes to
0	yeah it doesn't say that
0	right it's just an interpretation of it because the bible was originally written in arabic which is the language jesus spoke
1	and being a liturature major you can interpret literally anything into what you think what the right argument
0	yeah it's been it's been 2013 years since you can definitely do a lot of things with it you can definitely interpret it in different ways as so many christians have done yeah there's a lot of ways you can interpret it in fact we have a church here in merced that actually accepts gay people for who they are
1	no way aw
