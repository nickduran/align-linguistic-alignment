1	Okay so what do you think about gay and lesbian marriage?
0	I think they have the right to get married just like normal like female male marriages if they love eachother they should have the right to express their love like others can
1	I feel the same way as you do. Um yeah of course they just like everybody else they have the civil right to love and choose to love whoever they want and end up if they choose to get married to eachother that's totally fine.
0	Not really I mean they're just expressing their love for one another so i mean if I walk in with my boyfriend I want to express I want to show everyone that I love him as much as he loves me so if they want to like tell everyone that they love eachother then they should do it so like they have like I don't see why people are against happiness you know
1	Yeah I think the same way um do you think in the future people will accept it more or
0	Yeah because in the future I think people are going to be more open minded like they're more like since like and like people change generations change so I think that in the future people are going to be more like open to change more you get what I mean
1	Yeah like how our generation is totally changing from our parents yeah I agree I always ask my parents too I'm like so what do you guys think about it and at least for my parents they're not against it or at least mine aren't but they're just like it's really wierd to see them like expressing their love towards one another in public and like of course so its weird for them to probably see that now so yeah I always ask my parents that too
0	#Cause they didn't see that in their time
0	Yeah it's like I have a lesbian friend and like yeah I know they're like the best ones $ um
1	Oh me too and I have gay friends too they're awesome *
1	$ they're the best friends, yeah of course um yeah definitely like I always hypothetically talk to my parents like if you were to end up having like a kid who decided to be gay or lesbian what would you do and my parents are always like you know they're still our kid so like you can't really do much about it you'd still love them but it's sad to hear the parents yeah
0	(the parents yeah all they want is their own kid's happiness)
1	That's very sad but definitely they they have just the same amount of rights like everybody else
0	Yeah they do
1	Do you know any same sex marriages?
0	Not personally but I have a couple of friends that date and I'm like I'm cool with them like its just happy like sometimes I think their relationship is better than mine you know
1	Yeah better $ yeah that's true I know a couple both my brothers live in San Fransisco so they know a bunch of people who I mean who have been together cause I know after like a certain amount of years if you've lived together then you're automatically like married I guess? And yeah I mean it's true like they seem to have better relationships than ours $
0	$ I don't think there's that much jealousy involved you know
1	Oh there probably is $ there probably still is but their relationship's pretty stong I guess. They're just proud of it which is good.
0	Really strong*
0	(They seem to overcome everything well)
1	Definitely I agree
1	Um what else? What do your parents think about gay marriage?
0	Well I asked my mom what she would think if I was like that and she'll be like anything that makes you happy will make me happy so I'm glad to hear that my mom is being more open minded and so. My dad is more close minded he's really no but I'm just like yeah
1	So is my mom. What about your dad?*
1	I think it has to do with like the culture cause I know like at least are you hispanic latino? Yeah so am I so mainly the men are like no you have to be like the manly man macho style so that's hard for them to realize cause I have two like well one of my really good friends from high school both of her younger siblings came out to their parents one as lesbian and one as gay and I know they had a really hard time taking it they said oh no you have a psychological problem we're gonna take you to like get therapy and since they aren't in our generation you know it isn't a psychological problem its just my choice so it's pretty interesting to see how they take it and how they think it's like an illness or just something wrong but thats their choice and they're kind of the dad is definitely the one who has had a harder time with it but
0	yeah that helps*
0	I think like over time like they'll be more accepting to like letting their kids
1	Because it's not like their kid's going to go anywhere it's not like he's changing he's still the same person it's just who he chooses to love yeah it's pretty hard to see that the the like yeah it's very sad it's like they're still your kid they haven't changed in any way just how they think
0	you love someone*
0	(parents not as)*
0	they have the same level of feeling like you know at the same time I also think like you know how parents want better for their kids? well like when they want to express their love for someone it's like like like if they're happy with them but you're telling them like you don't accept them for who they are like okay that's not better than like that's just like bringing them bringing the child down you know what I mean?
1	Definitely I definitely agree there's been I think like here a couple years ago or two years ago I think it was my freshman year that um uh a guy from one of the fraternities I think he committed suicide because he came out to his parents and his parents like completely um ignored him so it's very sad to see like to hear those news around the world and in the US of people doing that because of the rejection from family members and their parents so I don't know people just need to realize it's and I hate it how they think it's like an epidemic now its like its not that it's just that people are now have like the confidence of coming out because they know that they won't get like rejected or like well they still are of course but not as much maybe as back then so cause I've heard thats like I don't know what's going on now kids are being born gay and lesbian and it's like no it's just they're they've decided to finally come out because they're in a generation where they're accepted yeah definitely
0	hm hm*
