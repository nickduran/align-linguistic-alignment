0	go for it. #
1	you can go first now.
0	um I am I am pro gay and lesbian marriage. I do not know where you stand but I think that it it is if it is allowed to only one group that that does not follow the constitution and that is where it is. it is not like a religious thing for me. it is like a moral constitutional thing for me. so
1	well like I am like against it because like I do not like think it is like like apropriate. because like like how I like grew like up like that is not like what I saw. you know? so um I mean I do not think it is like right.
0	I grew up in a similar situation but um I think that because we allow like straight people to get married but we are like no you can not I do not I do not feel like that that is the right way to go. but I think for me it is like if you do not want a gay marriage do not get one. like you do not have to like it is everyone's right to do like to have equal rights in the united states so if it is not if it is only allowed to some people but not to others that is when I get like fired up and a little mad. #
1	okay yeah like you mean like well well I am like half half like part way where like I like come from like my religion it is like it is not like right you know?
0	. I think um there are several religions that feel that way too but in the constitution it also says like seperation of church and state. so if we are going to like enjoy the rights of being an american then we should like use all of the rights not just pick and choose which ones we want to agree to like hurt a specific group. I think it is there is a lot of examples over history of like when the united states has done that and said oops just kidding we were wrong but we will stay on topic like GPS but. # I think this follows it like falls into that line of that pattern of history that we keep doing and then going back on.
1	what if like you had like a child and like they were like like that like situation like would you like support them or like how like how would you feel? yeah.
0	if I had a gay or lesbian child? yeah I would # I would not say no you are wrong if I had a son like you can only marry a girl. like I want my son to experience love just as as I have and if that is the way he was born and that is what he wants to do I will fully support him and um I realize it is against some religions but there is I am not very well versed in the bible but I know that there is a lot of like discrepancies but I do know the ten commandments are very like um kind of like the right thing to do. I we do not really have to get into like the religion side. # like I grew up in a very like conservative christian household too and um I see where like those pressures come from. like those social pressures and and I grew up in a very like conservative community in clovis and that is not like the general consensus but um I guess I can not I am kind of out there but that about is how I feel when I think that if we are going to like pledge allegance to the flag then I think we should acknowledge all of those laws.
1	right #
1	okay um
0	and it also like I do not want to feel like I am talking at you but um you do have the right to have your opinions too. so
1	no no.
1	um do you want to ask me anything?
0	mm what would what would you do if you had like a gay or lesbian son or daughter?
1	well I would like like talk like with them like um I would like tell them like what is like like right and like wrong like according to um like what I think and like the people around us and that I would like just like let them like to like whatever they want like like uh what like whatever their like decision is. you know what I mean?
0	see um just be clear you said like you would talk to them about like trying to convince them to be straight or okay I do not know if it is that much of a choice. like that is where I am stuck.
1	but but like I would not like support them though.
0	you I am sorry what?
1	like I like would not you know support them though.
0	so like support in like what kind of way like financially or like you would they would have to leave the house?
1	yeah like financially or yeah.
0	oh okay.
1	because it would I do not know that is how what I feel.
0	yeah. um I do not I do not know how much of a choice it is for those individuals. I have a lot of um friends in the gay and lesbian community and a lot of them say that um I guess those are like individual cases but it started when they were really young. so like on the playground and do you even know about sex like that really? like I do not I do not know if it is something that they can learn it might be biological of course they have not proved that yet. at least to me. very small knowledge on the topic. # so I do not know if I could hold that against like a boss or a child. like I do not think I could hold it above their head if that is kind of the route they want to go. like I do not want them to feel like they have to pick their mom or the person that they love like that would that would break my heart. It would be a hard situation I agree. how are we on time? um I also feel very similarly for like trans gender issues. like I do not feel like they they chose that I feel like that is biologically based. so that is also a really like touchy subject and hard to like wrap your head around. but I do not think I could hold that over a child's head. I do not know. what are your opinions?
1	um like I do not like really control it you know? like but like you could um like just like talk I mean you can not like you can not like really change them like who they are. so um I mean I mean it is hard. if if you like are the way you like are you can not like like really do anything like thing about it so but like it should not be that way.
0	*yeah. yeah.
0	um it should be what way?
1	like like like it should not like be like the way like that like they are like exposing themselves. you know what I mean?
0	exposing themselves?
1	like as like gay or lesbian.
0	so I am just trying to like wrap my head around it. #
1	like if if you like want like raised in that like like environment like would you like be you know what I mean? Like if if if you are not yeah.
0	Yeah I have a lot of yeah like are you talking (___)? so I have um my very best friend his name is john and he grew up in a very very conservative household just like I did and um he got to college and he came out as a gay man and um like my small community was not very happy about that but I think because he grew up in such like a conservative household it was like I do not love you the way you are. so you have to be you have to fit this mold or I do not love you. like witholding that love. and that has really impacted his life in a hard way and he he moved away and I do not see him very frequently but um it was kind of like I only love you if coming from his dad. and that was really hard for him. like I can not imagine I do not know if you could. like I be like my dad telling me I do not love you because you are blonde. and or I do not love you because you are a girl.
