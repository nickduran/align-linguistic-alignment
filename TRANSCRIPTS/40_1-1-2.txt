0	alright um
1	um should i go first
0	yeah go for it
1	okay so i think abortion is alright i don't find a big problem with that at all um it it kinda helps those that are in that type of trouble um get out of those situations...
0	Sorry, the ones that are not kind of ready for it?
1	Yes, ready for that, and so it helps them maintain reasonable living standard for them.
0	I kind of feel like, it's like it's your choice, it's like you've got to man up to your choice, like if you decide to have this baby then you- it's like the next thing. You got to start becoming an adult basically, but if you're not ready to do that the choice of abortion. I don't know. It's like the choices you make in life is for a reason, if you're not ready for it then ()
1	What else about abortion. I remember something during the presidental election, did you hear about this? When Mitt Romney said something about women who get raped. They should (). Cause you know how republicans aren't pro-abortion, cause (you had) a pro-choice. I'm not really political myself, I just learned this stuff just be hearing it from word of mouth. But I heard that republican, or Mitt Romney when he was running he said something about how women who were raped they should keep the child still. I don't know. I thought that that was kind of wrong.
0	I feel like it has to be one both side like they have to both agree on like do they want to have this baby or not. (). She had no choice.
1	Exactly because she had no choice of what happened there and you can't force her to bear a kid that she never wanted. Because then she won't show that same love to a child, because of course that child will always be a remindre of what happened. And of course he said she shouldn't get aborted, and I was thinking that is kind of weird because I bet if one of your daughters got raped because he has daughters too and I bet you would make your daugther get that abortion right away if she got raped.
0	Put yourself in their shoes.
1	So that's why I think abortion is fine that it should be an option
0	Totally be an option for everyone.
1	It should be an option because everyone has different living circumstance and even though in other senses it might not be the best option because of course those that are againt it they are just like it's more of a (probably) religious aspect of it saying that you're killing a human being. But also it's kind of I know-
0	It's like you're preventing for something worse to happen. You don't want the kid to live a life they hate.
1	Exactly because I don't thing something good will come of that especially if that kid won't be treated like they way a kid should be. With love and respect and all that. So that's one thing. So I respect that, so if you didn't know that () more, like they are for it. I was actually switching my words around I said that republicans are pro-coice it's actually democratics that are pro-coice. So they are the ones who have- and then the republicans are very religious in one sense and they have to respect that side where they are saying you can't have an abortion.
0	It's the first time I'm hearing that, I'm not a big (politician).
1	I heard this within the last six month before like during this election. I really had no idea much about it. I think abortion is fine because like I said you need to () everyone has just different circumstances and this is a very life changing choice and I mean if it's not wanted by the person that's bearing the child then what's the point of having the child.
0	Yeah who wouldn't want like-
0	What's the point of having it, yeah
1	Especially if it's done in an earlier (fashion?) like it won't be as bad because the kids aren't even fully developed during (). It't not really there yet. Well actully there's another argument about. I actually dont (). I'm not going to try againt that because I don't really know much about it, but I just think if anything then hopefully the person after getting that abortion they will just learn their lesson and understand that getting sexually involved is a big deal and it's very- they will grow () they will start maturing from that point.
0	It's a big deal.
0	It's a big deal.
1	Start thinking aboout the right choices you make in life.
0	Yeah, if you're goint to do both.
0	It would be a big change.
1	What else, I can't think if anything else.
0	There's a lot of big fuzzes about like you're taking the babies lives away it's not your choice to take it away. It's like you're digging ahead like you don't want to baby to be growing up like a baby that you didn't want.
1	Yeah you're looing past that.
0	that woman or
1	Yeah it's () because I mean first of they made it. I mean her and who ever else made it and it should be their choice to make.
0	To have it or not to have it.
1	Cause if they cant
