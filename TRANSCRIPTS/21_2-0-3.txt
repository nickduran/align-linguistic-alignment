1	Um gay marriage what do you think about it?
0	I think it should be it's
1	Um I think it should be um I mean there's like certain things about it that are like kind of difficult like for example the because apparently they can do like taxes together and stuff like that but that would be completely um there's like a few things that just it would be kind of I guess difficult to get together like adoption too like I don't know if there actually um if um the two for example they wanted to adopt so i mean personally think they should that could be like something that other people might not agree with like they might say oh you know what if that changes the child's sexuality i don't think it will but that might be something and um yeah what do you think? ha$
0	hm i think it should be legal um i think other people are always going to have like different opinions so like if one's like (something) like religion would be an influential factor like thats other people christians, catholics I don't think they would support it but I think overall like today there's like more openly gay people so I think it should be legal. Like if um if they want to marry then (something)
1	mm um what was like your opinion about the whole adoption thing?
1	Like for like example if two women were like say if it's legalized like two women who are married like adopting children. Two women adopting children. Do you think you'd be okay with that?
0	#I think that its
0	I think if its legal it would be easier for people to adopt but if its like they're like oh they're married already its like its like marriage so like it shows they're together and they're like um that they're like it's a serious committment and so I think like marriage would be like a stepping stone so it'd be like easier for couples to adopt and I think this helps people who are pansexual like uh if a kid has a sex like his parents that doesn't like essentially it enforces their sexuality. Like um I think there was one study that said that um their kid can actually like uh (miss normal parenting or its like its or something like that?) Like its kind of like more understanding yourself.
1	They use it to (more)*
1	i think there is a different relationship when you have two people in the same marriage as parents for example. Like its um lets see um well isn't it legalized in some places right now?
0	(You're talking about...)
1	$ Cause I heard that like some people can get married and they'll but there's just like only in certain states or I think it was in the past and then they took it off I don't know.
0	I think for California it was in the past and then they took it off I think (something)
1	removed it
1	Well I'm not sure I think I think they're working on it right now or it passed I'm not even sure I think it might have passed (something)
0	I think that the (government might have but I'm not sure I think there's been suits) I'm not sue
1	mm um
1	Do you think it, it would be like different for like let's say um like women and women or men and men?
1	How like would they be treated like is that what you're saying? like marriage or both
0	No I don't think well like I don't um I don't think they would be treated the same cause like women and women is more acceptable than men and men so like because of society's norms I don't think it's gonna be like exactly uh
1	I think for women it's much more acceptable
1	And um what would your opinion be on like um like for example lets say okay lets say they accept would they be uh should they be able to legalize it like everywhere in the United States? Or just certain places.
0	I think it should be like everywhere in the United States.
1	Like every state.
0	I think South states would be way harder though because of like their population.
1	Yeah I was thinking that.
1	Yeah and there's like some states who are more religious and so that would be different but I'm pretty sure a lot of people would would disagree with the whole passing.
0	I think in like the more liberal states like California New York and like states like closer to coasts like New York they usually they usually have like liberals in there so I think they would have an easier time passing than like say Mississippi or something like that. Yeah its like not going to pass (there). So if it was legal I think it would have to be enforced for all states cause if they give them the option like if you want to you can legalize it I don't think it's going to be effective.
1	hm hm*
1	i know you have*
1	Do you think it would have like an impact on our society like for me like do you think more people are going to start considering like mayve same sex marriage instead of like maybe having like instead of a guy looking for a girl would they be considerate or more open minded about it being a guy as well?
0	I mean personally I think that that wouldn't be a problem because I think like if you're gay then you're gay and I don't think it's necessarily influenced, I think its like, I think its more of a like your point of it or like that's how you are. It's not like if um if you're gay if it's legal or it's not legal you're always gonna want that sex so like a guy will always like another guy and a girl will always like another girl I don't think it's necessarily because of uh I don't think it would be affected by law. So I don't think it would like damage any like homosexual relationships so like I guess one of the arguments is that it might reduce reproduction rates and it might decrease the population and stuff like that but from my point of view I don't think it would be like that cause like I think if like a person is straight then they're straight if they're gay then they're gay so I don't think that it will have an influence on that.
1	Like there is no peer pressure like*
1	It wouldn't have any um impact
1	Do you think um it might affect children? Like you know how most of the time kids are like usually blend in? (With sex just in general its not when you're older) they're usually introduced to it in like middle school but like do you think it would be a problem when they're in school and like being teased that maybe they have like two same sex parents.
0	I think it would, like the way our society is set up right now I think it would be like
1	Yeah so it's like is our society ready for this?
0	Um I don't think it's ever going to be ready if you just like let it progress and it might be like after a long time but
