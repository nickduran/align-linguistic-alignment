1	ok well uh I am kind of like I could understand both sides but I guess if I had to chose one I would lean towards monitary need
0	yeah why?
1	u because uh I think everyone should like have an equal chance of going to college and I understand that like people who have good grades like deserve to be like I mean they deserve to be like I mean they deserve to be awarded for their good grades but they may they may have like already have the funds to go to college whereas someone who like might not have as good of grades but like still has fine grades does not get like money for it like might not have money to go to college and then why should they be like punished just because they do not have the money and their grades might not be as good
0	well I think that it should be more academic because I feel like it is more of a like better return on your investment because you know if you have grades and everything it is kind of like you have this like like yeah I can see where if I invest this amount of money in this person that they are going to do like they are going to have a good return on my investment
1	yeah I mean I get what you are saying I I understand how like it would definately be better for like colleges or like I mean let us just be honest colleges usually look out for themselves so but I feel like for like like humanitarian society wise it would be better for like to help the people because like someone might not have like might have better grades that like if you have two people and they like they might be exactly like just as like smart or whatever as eachother but like one might have better grades than the others because they are like have more money and like they might have like be able to like afford the tutors and everythingthat this person might not be able to so it is like we are like ok so like since you have all these luxuries we are going to like give you more money to go to our school than this person who does not have luxuries and then are already like down there haha like
0	but i mean like how would you like go about ok these are the people who we are going to give money to because of like monitary needs because like if you think about it that could be like a lot of people you know because a lot of people you know everyone is like society we need people to get education or anything so that could be a lot of people and they really do not they are not cut out for like college and stuff like that
1	yeah that is true haha that is why I kind of terrible but like I mean I still I even though I like understand your side I still like I do not know if I am allowed to say this but I agree but like I still think that like I do not know I just I just I still feel like if someone is like like because the question was which one should we like give more to and I feel like we should give like I am not saying we should not give to people I am not going to like I just feel like we should give more to people who are are like poor and I am not saying like a little bit poor but like actually poor poor people like can not afford a college education at all because yeah and they might not even be recognized by like colleges because what if they do not like have all of the high school grades or things because they could not like they had to like work or something I do not know this is like far fetched but like I do not know a scenario like that happened and they do not have like the I mean they have the ability to like test but like you have to pay for the SAT and so yeah it is hard
0	# haha
0	* yeah
0	# haha
0	* yeah
0	* yeah
0	yeah but they do give out like the little things for the SAT I do not know how that works but yeah haha
1	yeah but it is like it is like a long process and like not everyone can do that so I just feel like we should give them money to look for
0	# haha yeah
0	but yeah I still think it should be like academic because there are like poor people I guess because there is like you hear those stories every once in a while where this person was homeless and then all of a sudden they are to Harvard and stuff
1	yeah like once every like nine years haha like yeah I mean you do here things like that but that is just because like
0	because I think if you are like if you have like the academic like grades and stuff like that it does not matter because I think there is just some way around like I understand what you are saying about like you might not have like you can not take the test and all this other stuff but then I think I feel like there are ways around to where you still can like go
1	* yeah
1	there are I mean I am not trying to say that like we should not like I mean we should give money like if someone has is not like bright and they are like do not have uh funds to go to college I am not saying we should give them like money like I mean not just because they are not bright but because I mean if they are not trying they do not deserve a reward but if people are like trying and they are uh where was I going with this? People are like trying to like uh show that they are smart and trying to do uh what needs to be done to get to college and they might not have the funds are you not going to give it to them and give it to someone who already has the funds and is has better grades but already has the funds?
0	# haha yeah
0	can you repeat that I am sorry
1	ok haha like if you uh if there is someone and haha and they like do not have the funds but they are trying and they have ok grades are you going to not are you going to like give that possible money instead of to them to someone who has really good grades but has the funds?
0	* yeah
0	but like what you were saying about the ok grades that kind of goes back to what I am saying about the investment thing is that like I mean because then you have to get into like what are thier circumstances of them having ok grades because yeah I can understand why you were like yeah they have jobs and take care of family and stuff like that but then that is going to like a whole nother thing you know? that they have to get involved with you know? that is more of a social aspect that they are going to have to like you know? haha
1	haha like what do you mean?
0	no because it is like because then like if someone has like ok grades right? instead of just you are going to have to like really get down deep into to the root of the issue you know? like you can not just take it for face value you know like oh they have ok grades so maybe they are not trying or something like that you know because that is really up to the individual that is basically kind of a way they do it now
1	* yeah
1	yeah I mean I understand you are not going to like always know the circumstances of why someone might have those grades but I mean haha how are you going to know how are you going I mean if you do not know the circumstances are you just going to like brush off anyone and then if someone really like just does not have like is really smart and has the capability and if they were in college they would not have all these distractions but because they are not they are they have all these distractions like they might have to raise fifteen kids I do not know like how are we going to like just assume that they are their grades are bad because they just are not trying and give it to someone who might have good grades but might not have any distractions in life so that is why their grades are so good
0	* yeah
0	yeah but I mean that just puts more of a burden on the like college system I guess the universities and stuff like that
1	# yeah but whatever they are here to help us so
0	# because it is easier like true well they are not here to like go to your house though and be like haha
1	# no I know but the school whole schooling education is to make society better and
0	* yeah
