0	so yours is
0	democrats? oh I have republican.
1	what is yours?
1	I see
0	so okay so for you um the whole agenda and stuff what is um the democrat party um like convince them to side with you on however you want to put it.
1	um honestly being a democrat came from my parents just because they are democrats so that is who I identify with but um from what George Bush um his presidency and what he came out of it um we are a poor family so basically he did not help us out at all. I am not saying that Obama is helping us or anything but I am just saying that like he really did not um he did not help the poor and he just kind of lets out the rich people basically and putting us out there in unnecessary wars and stuff like killing our money and I mean that is why I do not really really know much about politics um but it is just basically something that has been handed down to me I guess kind of I do not know. what do you think about it? about republicans?
0	well here is my reason for republican. um I know it is a big thing I can not just like convince you within ten minutes to just switch political parties but I hope you at least take a little bit more in consideration to the republican party. so basically I believe the republican party works on some sort of reward system for say I am not to good at this but um. so you know how I admit they do some somewhat favor the rich um because the rich what is it like they did not get there just because luck. okay maybe some but the majority they pulled themselves up from the bootstraps. and the poor were given as much opportunity as anyone else to become that rich person to succeed in school. like we are given this education likeas we have once again as much opportunity as anyone else. and once we get up there with the support we are given we are given a lot of support we will also be rewarded so I mean think about it the republican party rewards hard work although you would have to get to that point and unfortunately I do not know if your parents are um immigrated here or not um but it was hard on them but the opportunity that they gave you to become that wealthy successful person will later later in life you will benefit from that republican party through your hard work. do you understand what I am trying to say?
1	. yeah.
0	so although it might not favor your parents' situation it will greatly favor your future. as long as you keep up your hard work and you will become successful.
1	yeah but it is like I mean where are my parents going to be involved in that you know? they are my family.
0	well with all the money you are going to make in the future and how the republican people or party will favor you you are there to take care of them plenty.
1	I do not know about that honestly. I do not know like our government under George Bush went from like fucking I am sorry I guess # went from like a ten to like a two because he just I did not see him as a good president and I was little too when he was president and um I viewed him more like as someone who did not even know what he was doing. um I am not saying I am not saying Obama knows what he is doing either you know like. I am just kind of putting putting it out there that he does not know how to deal with situations like uh hurricane katrina or the nine eleven. He does not really I mean. the republican party I am not even like I said I do not really know anything about politics I am not a poli-sci major. um but it is like I feel like the democratic party might give us more opportunities. um I mean I guess the republican party too I did not know anything about what you just talked about but.
0	no no. so go ahead. it is
0	um so so right now for our generation as for republicans George Bush pretty much defines the republicans right? so basically during his presidency he had to face one of our most modern wars up to this day. so it was on a whole new scale from any one we have already faced. and in my opinion he although it might seem like he did a bad job he did a good job compared to whoever else could have handled that job. so basically giving someone else the task they would have done a lot worse than what George Bush did.
1	give an example of who.
0	let us say um uh let us go with let us go with his dad or something. um George Bush senior. he is um older there is a lot of older people in politics he might not be as familiar with a modern with modern warfare as much as his son would be. what is it uh we pretty much we came in there we did our job um we were regulating there.
1	what was sorry. what was the whole point of that war?
0	so basically um weapons of mass destruction were basically the point of that war and we recieved intelligence that there were weapons of mass destruction over there and then um so we went and what is other than that terrorist attacks clearly. so um they are not just going to fly a couple of planes or not even a couple. they are just not going to attack like our main cities and we are going to not just going to sit there and say do not do it again. so clearly we went to war they had weapons of mass destruction and we got to go infiltrate them do what they can take down their leaders which we did. um and
1	Obama did.
0	yeah um but then Obama kind of just picked up where George Bush did. I believe they would have got there at the same time either way. um because he basically just used whatever information George Bush left him. and as for hurrican katrina I think he handled that well because I mean it is fine right now is not it? um other other than that in general we can other handle really modern topics that involve both parties. are you aware of the current um SOPA or um CISPA bills?
1	. yeah.
1	no. not at all.
0	um so basically it is going to regulate like a lot of internet stuff such as um illegal downloads and stuff yeah.
1	oh yeah. oh yeah I heard about that.
0	but it is not only illegal downloads. it is a lot of other stuff on the internet um piracy being the main one that everyone can relate to. but as of now um the republicans are trying to push that bill to regulate all that piracy so that um we can not just like illegaly download whatever we want and then and the democrats are the majority of them are trying to um um have that bill not pass.
1	I I agree I mean what is the point of doing that? you know like you are just I do not know like
