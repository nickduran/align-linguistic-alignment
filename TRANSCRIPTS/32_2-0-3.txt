1	So what do you think?
0	I said to legalize it.
1	To legalize it?
0	What did you said no?
1	No I said no.
0	Why did you choose that?
1	Well you know just because for, you know as long as we've been taking like health classes or whatever and we learn about all the drugs and all that stuff right? We always or while they've always told us that it's a gateway drug right? So we wouldn't want, you know we wouldn't want to get more of these kids or whatever to start you know start off with marijuana and then go on to, other exactly. And you know I mean I understand the reasoning to why people want it legalized right because either way people aren't going to stop doing it, but I just think the fact that it being illegal keeps some kids from doing it and it's just you know it helps with at least some of them knowing or giving them a thought that maybe they shouldn't.
0	Other bad things
0	. I know what you mean I get it um I just meant the that um usually people or some people they tend to do things that are illegal, yeah that's pretty much my point. And how they wouldn't be or some people wouldn't be caught doing it and get in trouble that badly because I know it's like somehow um like the in thing to do now and people just do it because it's there and then the other reason is that it really is for like medical reasons or other people, and yeah they have that that green card or not green card
1	Which is legal for them.
0	Yeah. But somehow people will just get those cards.
1	Yeah and then we'll always find a way to go against law right just, and I always bring in history but like you know Prohibition they had you know the they banned alcohol and what ended up happening right they had these speak-easies and went off and did it themselves illegally and things like that always happen until obviously they legalized it again um, but you know I just think it's already you know we already have too many problems and legalizing this will give kids another reason to say oh well you know who cares it's legal I can do it, why not? And then start doing other drugs and who knows maybe they'll legalize that too right just because they're doing that ill illegally or you know to be able to tax a lot out of it right? So I just don't think it's ethical and correct, in general.
0	. I get that.
1	And because you know it could ruin kids' lives or whatever there's already enough alcoholics out there, and then to I mean know marijuana's not addictive but the thought of you know starting to do other drugs, but yeah you know I understand though the, why or the reason behind legalizing it especially for the taxing and right? For all of that which will help the country out probably with the taxes coming in but you know it could rise and other negative aspects.
0	And I was thinking that too about that government thing how if it was legal they could just tax you and get more money for it and they could like, build up the prices for it so it's harder to get for some people or those um that are really that become addicted to it.
1	Right? But like let's say you know they will tax a lot right for that making it really expensive too so then people will still continue to get it illegally from others growing it illegally
0	But not as easily.
1	Not as easily but it could be cheaper and they always find out ways around things they will always do that, so I mean if anything it'll probably it'll just be more expensive for people who need it for medical use.
1	I'm not trying you know keep up with 8 minutes $
0	I'm on the spot.
0	I think I should change my answer.
0	Because I understand what you mean all your points and stuff, I was just thinking about that one main point of how people are usually attracted to doing bad things because it's bad and they want that like they're all doing something that not a lot of people would do since it's illegal. And then I don't know they tend to usually I thought they would. I know I read something on it it was um how people would tend to stop doing some actions when it was legal.
1	Which is always a problem for kids to xxx rebelling and all that stuff.
0	ah rebel
1	And if legal and if legalizing marijuana right won't have that factor anymore they'll just go for something else
0	Yeah, that's true
1	something worse.
0	Do you think it should stay legal? Um, like the restrictions on it to be stricter than because I know some people that have it with them like in the car or something or they'll just be found with it and the worst that, I think the cop will do is just take them to jail for like a few days or just not even do that and just take it away take them away it depends. I know if a cop catches you with it it depends on how much you have that what they'll actually do like if it's just like a tiny little bag they'll just take it away and that's it... And it's weird how the marijuana's like used in a lot of media though, like the No-ers. That one and then some like music videos and the lyrics to the music, it's just become like the in thing
1	Oh yeah
1	the xxx and yeah
1	And the media stuff that goes into it too, yeah.
0	They make it seem so like not a big problem
1	accountable and yeah
1	Which is why it has become one because you know oh it's not that bad it you know you don't get addicted to it alright well, they don't see the big picture you know they don't go beyond that they don't they don't think.
