0	Okay so we both agree that abortion is bad.
0	Okay what do you, why do you say that?
1	Because god doesn't like that it's a sin to do that
0	So your saying based on your like your religion background.
0	Well I think that too and I believe that like it's a blessing from god so the baby didn't ask you to be born so it's really like not the baby's fault so like you shouldn't kill the baby.
1	Yeah so religous based too. Nice. Um it's also against you know the government to kill people and it's basically killing a baby so
0	Because it's part of the, I, well a lot of people say that it's a fetus so it's not considered a person but to me it's a baby it's a person. So your killing a person so your killing someone, your killing someone. And um lot of people like say that it's like your, like your right to do it but I don't think it is because what about the baby does the baby not have rights, the baby should have rights.
1	Yeah they don't need to die for something. Yeah I hear a lot of people say that too I don't know we should have the right.
0	Because it's, it's like sombody it's a person.
1	But they can go you have the right so therefore you know. Yeah.
0	And um another thing that I think is that gives the baby rights um there's like a lot of protection for you not to have babies and if you didn't use it that's pretty much your fault so why take it out on the baby. Like the baby didn't tell you not to use protection so that's your fault if you get pregnant or not.
1	I mean if you didn't want to have a baby in the first place then you like shouldn't have sex in the first place. What else?
1	Then what would the opponents think?
0	That it's like the girl's body or whatever, oh like, like, like if your boyfriend and you have a baby or whatever um your boyfriend can't decide if you can keep it, like you, if you want the baby and he doesn't he can't say anything about it because it's your body technically but if he's the dad he should have the right to but no or whatever.
1	And then there's adoption you could just give a baby up for adoption.
0	You don't have to kill it if you don't want it just give it up for adoption. There's a lot of other things you can do besides killing the baby.
1	Yeah a lot of people say because they don't want to bring the baby to this ugly, ugly world.
0	Then don't have sex in the first place and you won't bring any babies and then how would you feel if your mom wanted to abort you?
1	I'd kill her $ just kidding, I don't know I mean right now if she tried to abort me then I can't imagine it because I wouldn't be here um.
0	If like you could say that like if you have the right to live like you should give the right to someone else.
1	I think it's the most amazing gift to have babies so why kill them.
0	kill them
0	And it's against the law anyways so your going against the law by killing the baby. And then it's, for the girl's it's um it's babd because after you do it a lot of the girls the moms end up having depression and they end up having like infectionsor something and they end up being sick. Ans then I read that um a lot of girls who do abortions end up like having breast cancer and stuff like that so it's like your putting your life at risk too when you could just have the baby and give it up for adoption if you don't want it.
1	Yeah and then if they start doing it once there more, most likely going to do it more times. Plus like that would hurt her future.
0	Yeah and then a lot of girls are going to regret it later so I mean just don't do it.
1	I talk to this lady that had an abortion and she says that she can't sleep at night so abortion is bad.
0	Yeah I did for my church I did like a presentation on abortion and then there was this girl crying I don't know if she had an abortion but she was probably like fifteen she was like really crying but she was, first she was making a joke of it like oh abortions are and then I put a video because we talked about it and then um she started crying. And then when my mom was pregnant she had a little, one of my sisters the doctor told my mom that she was like going to have down syndrome so she told her that she should abort, like the doctor told her because she's like oh your not going to be able to handle a kid with down syndrome or whatever and then my mom just changed doctors and it ended up that she didn't have anything wrong with her. So you can't really relate like take doctors advice either.
1	Yeah you just have to take your own just abort because it's bad.
0	follow your heart but don't abort
0	What else would the opposing team would say?
1	Um that you could probably have more babies so it doesn't matter if you kill one.
0	But there be like risks for the girl after if you have an abortion because if it's not legal then you go to someone that does it illegally and when they're not doing it right or they're using like, like stuff that's not even clean and then it ends up giving you infections and diseases or something
1	Yeah there's other ways out you know you could sell your kid or something. I mean that's better than killing the baby.
0	Give it up or just leave it at a chruch or leave it at someone's house. You can leave it at the fire, fire, station, yeah and then it gets pickin up and taken somewhere.
1	Are you done?
1	Do you know
0	Oh and then there is one article I read about like this girl that had an abortion and then she started feeling sick after a couple weeks after so she went to a regular doctor and then he was like did you have an abortion and then she was like how did you know and he's like because they didn't like take the baby out right and they saw like his little foot so like you could that's like an example of how abortion is bad for the mom too because they can't, but if they don't do it right then I think like piece of the dead baby there and it gets you sick. So there's a lot of cons against abortion and just one pro that it's ther girl's decision, the girl's body.
1	Babies are pretty why would you want to kill them, they're a blessing from god.
0	If we knew babies I'd say they say they wouldn't want to die because I am pretty sure it hurts doing
