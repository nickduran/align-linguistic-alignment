1	okay so um i just said i was against it i've always held that view just because it's like it varies from state to stateand it can be confusing and it's just like a lot of like trouble to go through with changing the laws and what do you think?
0	i personally i'm against it but i'm open to people who are gay who would like to get married um
1	me too
0	um i don't know i was just kind of raised that way and
0	i'm not gay but i know a lot of people who are and like i can just i really empathize with them and thinking if i could marry likethe person i love like and you know the legal things that go with that um as far as like what is it like in the hospital like having your spouse be able to come in if their not married they get to sit in the waiting room i think that's pretty awful and stuff so i'm pretty open but personally like if i had kids i would be like no i'm not for it but
1	yeah and then i've also considered like if you um let them have a law for gay marriafe and it's legal then they can say that you can adopt but that could be really confusing for like kids and stuff
1	i mean people adopt that are gay you know right no but it's not it's not a marriage so it's not like legal so i thought about that too
0	okay so we can decide that we're for or against okay
1	we're against
1	legally we're against
0	alright i'm just trying to think of my points because it's like i'm kind of more i don't know but we can go for against
0	yeah haha
1	if people were if people were opposing it they would probably argue that like you know if like oppsite sex couples can get married why shouldn't gay couples but it's like like i said i'm like more on the legal side because i'm not against gay couples but if we were to go through like the juristriction of changing all laws you know that not all of the you know states are not all going to agree and it would just cause like a huge political uproar what do you think?
0	hm hm*
0	okay so your saying that it would cause a lot of chaos legally throughout multiple states and cause the country if we started saying it was okay like start changing laws
1	yeah liberals would agree but conservatives wouldn't
1	and i think if that was going to be on like the presidental ballot that would drastically [...] people's decisions to
0	yeah i'm under impression that the majority of the population is against um gay marriage and if that were on a ballot like a presidential campaign i think whoever said they would do it would probably loose support um so yeah i'm having trouble with this one this topic um
1	yeah that's what i think too
0	i kind of thought [..] i kind of think arguments like if we were to change this it would open a door towards many other legal issues trying to be adjusted and and the fact the case of like adoption is like a huge one [..] all for kids who don't have people who love them [..] but i do think it could be really confusing for a child depending on the age and where the circumstances in the home and stuff having two of the same sex parents and figuring out like should is that how i'm suppose to be am i wrong not wrong or right but like different
1	everyone one of them
1	yeah and i think that um like if they legalize gay marriage then it's legal that would cause a conflict for like the kids that are involved that are in schools because say they go to like a christian school or something like that the parents are going to be involved and the other parents aren't going to like that probably and so they would be like they'd be like outcasts and then the kids would suffer
0	yeah i i could see that being an issue especially with views of the parents [trickling] down to their children and perhaps being shunned or neglected by other students um i know to that like other countries are there are some that are very against um gay lesbian [..]
1	hm hm*
1	so also yeah that's makes me think that like if the u.s. legalized it were going to loose support from other countries then that could be reflected on our like trade or like financial ties to other countries countries that support us during war and countries we support so could have negative effects too
0	hm hm*
0	hm hm*
0	hm hm*
0	hm hm*
0	[...] um
1	so um if like if we were to change the laws to um there would be like conflicts with like you know marriage is legal worldwide say like a gay couple got married in the u.s. and then like one of them got relocated for a job there's like financial stuff involved with being married would that abolish that or not so
0	that's a good point i feel like shouldn't like like let's suppose that if the change does happen and it's legalize across our country what if people were to relocate or whatever the laws with other countries how would that conflict with the laws that we now have now passed and
1	like a perfect example i think about is like a couple that was married if one of them goes to the armed forces um when you like say you go overseas you can bring your family if they live on the base or something they get like the support because the other one that's not military has to leave their job but what if the country didn't support the marriage wha do they do do they just like they have to find another to like pay for their living expenses because they won't be supported by the
0	well i don't know the details on that kind of
1	so that
1	that's another reason that they would that wouldn't be a good idea
0	maybe the u.s. that i don't if the u.s. military are you saying if they're u.s. military or armed forces
1	yeah like if you were in like the u.s. marines or something and you were overseas in like japan or some where like that and like your like partner lives on the base if your not legally married i don't know if they if that's allowed because the partner that lives on the base their probably not
