0	ok so I think that marijuana should be legalized so that it can be government regulated and so that would stop from like a lot of illegal drugs coming in at the border and also like it's not a like it's not a bad drug like um the only like effect is just you just getting high $ but with like drinking you can get you know like liver damage and it's more dangerous o drive even though it's dangerous to drive when you're high it's more dangerous to drive when yo're under the infulence of alcohol
1	I agree like I feel like marijuana should be legal um and I feel like people using an excuse as like oh like this will lead to um this is dangerous blah blah blah I feel like that is coomplete bull crap because like cigarettes are dangerous alcohol is dangerous like cigarettes are like cigarettes are so freaking dangerous and so like for them to use marijuana being dangerous as an excuse um I feel like it's irrelevant because cigarettes kill people all the time and like same with alcohol um yeah so I feel like it should be legalized
0	and it's not as addictive either like there's no nicotine or like addictive chemical in it that you know will make you keep using it for like the rest of your life pretty much or like getting those like surgeries or whatever like the commercials you see on tv it's usually like about cigarettes and all like the effects of marijuana on you yeah
1	I feel like they just won't legalize it because they they they don't um they might be having like a hard time organizing it to where people don't grow it themselves and like then they'll lose money but I mean I think it's really stupid to like have to think like that because like people can make meth $ People can people can make alcohol people can people like um yeah so I don't know it's so like whatever if they're growing it they're gonna grow it anyways like growing marijuana is like a like it's oh it's a science like it's a lot of work like yeah $
0	yeah $
0	and then if they do end up like selling it like the government themselves and it would probably stop people from growing it as much or they could give people like jobs from doing it and they can regulate it that way
1	easy access
1	uh huh cause people if you think about it like people don't make alcohol as much as they used to like you know I had do you know people who like actually make their own beer um it's so much work that like the majority of the population doesn't do it cause we're lazy and want easy access so or not everybody's lazy but like that's just how our generation is I want it now but like um but yeah
0	and then there's the whole thing like oh if we keep it banned it will stop people from doing it but like they tried doing that with alcohol with the prohibition and then they just got a lot of bootleggers or um people making money off it themselves whether then like so it was still going on so they might as well use it and then then benefit off of it
1	yeah mm
0	or then maybe there's just that whole like fear like tabboo it's a drug but
1	like Ibuprofen's a drug there's a bunch of other drugs
0	yeah there's a bunch of other drugs and then they can use it for health reasons too I mean they already kind of do but like even more so like um is medical marijuana legal in texas? do you know?
1	uh huh
1	I don't know
0	um maybe it's not cause my yeah it's ok $ cause my grandma she's got um fibromialgia so she gets lots of pain and I don't think she has access to medical marijuana over here but we have it here and she came here and my dad like he got a maedical marijuana card and everything and then he got her like lollipops and stuff and it actually like helped her hand like um she didn't have any pain and rather than being like a bunch of pills that uh can like like um she had like a bad mix of pills once and she started like hallucinating and she had to be in the hospital forever but like instead of just doing that you could just you know like just have the marijuana like pills or pops or whatever and that just made her feel better without like you know like seven different kinds of medi yeah and there was no side effects too so there's that $ uh
1	I don't yeah sorry
1	All of the side effects
1	so have you seen weeds?
0	no $
1	Really? it's a really funny show about marijuna oh it's it's over now it got kind of weird in the last season but um like on weeds uh there were the one of the the main character she ended up like um making treats for the cancer patients with marijuana in them and I was like oh how cute cause this clown would come and sell them lollipops for like [...] and then take advantage of it cause it really worked so you can see like [...] even though it's a TV show $ I'm sorry I'm really tired $
0	I don't know
0	or it could also be like the people expressing their desire that they're ok with it and if the ma you know if people are ok with it then you know democracy $
1	yeah I feel like it's like it's a so much in America is like your own personal choice so it's just like why does it matter like I can understand like why drinking and driving is not legal even though it's your choice to drink and drive it still affects other people but like marijuana like if you wanna get high like that's not gonna affect anybody like there's so many people that smoke at our school and it has not affected em at all like I mean it just doesn't matter like yeah it doesn't bother me like um like even smoking cigarettes as long as somebody's not smoking in my walk my walk I don't care I mean I know on a like on a greater scale it matters like with the earth but if your gonna make that decision they're gonna make it whether I have and opinion about it or not so as long as we're respecting eachothers space then it shouldn't matter but I guess some people don't respect eachother's space
0	yeah it doesn't bother you or anything
0	and then they've also got like e;ectronic cigarettes so there's no smoke there's just like water vapor or so maybe they can do that with marijuana
1	yeah I mean I know like I know they they do have that with marijuana I think like I don't know like I think it's like a um I don't know I don't smoke I don't really smoke but
0	I was not aware $
0	$ yeah
0	and I remember I was reading like an article about it once and then she was just trying to make a point but she was saying that like when someone's under the influence of alcohol like they're liable to kill somebody where as like if you're like high you're just like pretty much gonna like stay at a stop sign forever waiting for it to turn green $ so yeah
1	yeah and then you just fall asleep or like um like I I've never driven high but like my friends who have driven high they said like they they're more aware because they're just they're just like in slow motion and so I'm like ok well if anything if somebody's speeding and they're not high and they're driving near somebody that's high that's when it might um cause they're cause that person speeding is expecting that person to go a certain speed limit and they are not so yeah I don't know like if I see somebody driving hella slow like at night I'm like they're high like I'm just gonna go around
0	be dangerous
0	yeah so there's like more positive things to it like even in worst case scenarios there's more positive to it than alcohol
