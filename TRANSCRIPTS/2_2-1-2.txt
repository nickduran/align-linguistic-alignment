1	ok I I I think we should change the legal drinking age to 18 um I think oh wait wait what do we agree on first?
0	I think we should change it to 18
1	The issue ok um just because like in all of the countries it's 18 I am pretty sure that we're like or it's younger I heard in like I don't know but I think that we're the only ones with that's 21 I think um and I think that there'd be a lot more like kess accidents especially because we're in college and stuff like that and everyone's like kind of bound to drink um and like I just feel like people likeyounger kids are more willing to lie to their parents about it so like if they got drunk or whatever they're not gonna call their parents to ask them to pick them up so they're more willing to drive themselvesand so I think it's like a bigger like risk factor in that area so that's
0	uh huh
0	wait you think it should be dropped to 18?
0	ok ok yeah so um I agree cause I think that if you think about it people or a lot of young kids are drinking already anyway cause they have resources to get their hands on the alcohol so why not make it kind of like a source of I guess taxing it or money for the economy right? if they're already using it they're just getting it illegally they might as well make it legal for them to drink and get the um get for the economy so they can just buy the alcohol and also um there was money um less trouble because they're not you know they're not trying to hide it so it's kind of if they can do it like you said a lot of them are younger so I think one drinking ageis like 14 I believe yea it's like 14, 16 um
1	just like a
1	yeah that's true
1	yeah I heard 14 and 16
1	but no I completely agree because like um like fake IDs like people aren't gonna need those and like kids are gonna be in so much less trouble like it's just gonna save so much time and effort like cops there and like ya know send them back home
0	no I totally agree I think it's just easier um not to mention the when you're hiding it then they get in more trouble then it's just yea it just doesn't work out that way and um oh there's like a Wikipedia about it when you legalize something then people they don't do it as much I guess in a sense so their wont be as many acts like you said accidents or um
1	I think just like the leading cause is the fact that they're trying to hide it that's like the main problem is tha kids are doing it behind like the law and behind their parents and so that's when it becomes a bigger deal is that like um kids are more willing to likelie to their parents and so liek that's gonna get them in way more trouble then like their parents already know that their legal enough to drink and then you're jsut I feel like you'd be a lot more responsible just cause like I mean you're not gonna drive yourself I would think like if you if you have parents that are ok with it your your parents are willing to pick you up or something or like friends or whatever
0	well even especially if it was lower to than they might offer more resources like I know for when your 21 they would offer certain things you know um your license of how you can drive you can't drink and drive I should say you can't drink and drive um how to carry yourself like what happens if someone blacks out and you can start that earlier in the process because a lot of times now its preaching um
1	yeah from like your parents your not really willing to listen to them it's like yea and if like they want educate more people at a younger age like they're more willing to do it like when they're older so it's just kind of like modeling the way
0	and right now people are preaching you don't do it don't do it it's illegal its illegal what if they were to have a little bit more open mind like hey this is it's illegal if it was legal they could say hey this is what happens this it what could happen protect yourself to you know do all these other things
1	because kids can't really do anything about it if they don't have the resources that are gonna save them from that kind of trouble so like the only thing they can resort to is like hiding it like they don't have anything else to do like
0	Right I agree i think and then like I said the economy is kind of in a bad place it's a little bit better but if its if you can get that income more flow cause itl be more wide population and it could help the economy get the resources
1	yea that one
0	so yes$
1	I feel like those are just like the main reasons
0	I feel like there's like 3 right? the not having to hide it so they'll partake in less hazardous activities and then um there's the economy and then also if you legalize it at a younger age then I mean there might be less people actually doing it on day you know on a weekend basis because it's teenagers get bored doing the same thing over and over again so once they get exposed to it then it's
1	I think it's like the adrenaline rush the fact that it's illegal is the reason why kids do it because its i don't know it just oh i'm doing something dangerous I'm doing something that's illegal like you know um and I feel like I understand like the whole concept of having it 21 just like parents are concerned that it's like we're too we're still young and that like by the time we're 21 we're almost out of college and so that's like we're more mature enough to handle situations like that but I just think that its just like psychologically it doesn't like for our age it doesn't work like that I think I understand like the parents concepts of it their reasoning
0	uh huh
0	and plus a lot of people will wait til they're 21 they they just explode at 21 and they just have that I'm gonna drink a lot I'm gonna drink a lot and it's like well that's also dangerous because at 21 you're out of college they have more time yeah that's what yea that's when you need to start figuring out like what your doing with your life too
1	yeah no yeah
1	that's when you need slow down
1	cause you kind of like not like it's a good thing but like you would rather get that out of your system and make trouble when you're younger than when you're older when you are like everything is abide by the law and you get in trouble you could go to jail but you 'd rather go through all that trouble when you're young and you have a better excuse to get out of it so it just makes more sense and if all the other countries in this world are have it at 18 like hwy don't we like ya know yep
0	right no
0	yeah no I agree no I totally agree
0	I think um cause when you're 21 then you just start partying then snf then you're too old to have to figure out a lot of the stuff
1	and that's like when you're about to like apply for grad school or find like a good job that's gonna set you for the rest of your future and like when you're a kid like youdon't really have to worry about that kind of thing
0	yea and it's like at when your 18 you could legally move out of your residence like you don't have to be your parents technically and you can vote you have all these adult rights your technically legally an adult but yet they yea you can't drink
1	mm yeah
1	you can't drink
1	yea like a lot of people say that a lot of our friends that are in like the military and stuff like that say like I can fight for our country but I can't drink a beer or something like that but yea it makes sense though
0	uh huh
0	Right it's true it is true
0	it is true how can we send these kids off to war and $
1	with guns and explosives
