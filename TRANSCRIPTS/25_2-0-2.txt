1	yeah I think we can start okay so universal health care would be a potentially good idea if um well because if you can't afford healthcare how you can't they can't help you and your worried about the odds of even paying your medical bills one of my TAs in chemistry was talking about one of his friend who didn't have medical insurance and then he got a weird tooth infection and then it got really bad and it got um infected and it cost him all his savings which is like twenty thousands just because he didn't have healthcare so I'm just like well then and odds are that people who don't have healthcare can't afford so then they're not going to be able to afford when they injured and then it goes not to us because they get in debt and then everyone's problem but if we just had universal health care and we all contribute to it and it won't be so bad [...]
0	I totally agree because um in that way like you were saying more people are covered so it's not a huge issue with um like how we're having to um well we have people when they have the need of cancer treaments you know they can't pay it and you know their family members end up dying or stuff it's I think it's better just for everyone to you know people to have the opportunity I don't think health should be denied to anyone like everybody has the right to be healthy and should be treated it shouldn't be based off of like you know whether you have the money or not so yeah
1	I guess we debated on the other side
0	um so the opposing view I guess the I've had some friends that tell me um that it would be more money taken away from them their taxes so they think they already give enough like you know they're already paying a lot for other people um they already pay a lot to give towards government so they're like why this too you know so it's more like it's not fair for them and they also say um you know everybody has to work up to where they're at so if they don't have the money for it then that's their fault type of thing so yeah that'll be like the opposing view at least that's just what I've encountered with most my friends
1	and then yeah also the opposing view is they don't get to chose if they can pay for it they have to then that's not fair it's against our rights but we have to think of a lot of things we don't have to chose for property tax and all the other tax I mean I guess you do chose it because you have property but you have even when you work they take taxes out of your income you don't chose that you don't chose sales tax well beside food but the fact that we have to eat but I feel like the government does a lot of things we can can't really chose and I don't think that's right but um I think this would be more benficial because yes they do work up to that but what happens when they get laid off and then they're like health insurance goes away to then they're in the same boat as everyone else and then the same people who are in that boat the it's not fair now because it's me it just like and [..]
0	ha ha
0	because then if it happens to them then o h my gosh what do I do now they get to you know kind of out yourself in their shoes so you can realize that you know your in their situation you've worked all these years and now like your saying a person gets laid off they don't know what to do and they may get sick or something might even develop cancer and they won't know how to pay for it well if we had universal care healthcare then you know they'll be able to cover that and that way it just works better because
1	and it's like
1	they choose
1	we should look at canada because they have it and they seem fairly happy and their fine and stuff so yeah if we were with other countries that do it and there doing just fine why can't we rule on things that are working to instead of like trying to
0	well you yeah
0	and another thing I've heard is um also that um if we allow more government control then it makes us seem more like socialist type of thing because then you know the government is like providing for everyone and everybody is trying to like pitches in but then it's all the government it's what they're saying is that more government control will so then our society kind of loses it's um competitiveness but it's just more like you know it's
1	yeah i guess [...] dont like that its collects more government [what we're doing it's so different because I mean] it's republicans that are really well off
0	I know it's
1	just like wow help the little people but like the people that are in college right now and they're not under their parents insurance what are we going to do we're not exactly working full time because we can't we don't have the time to do that and then what are we going to do we can get sick we're human still so
0	yeah it's yeah I just yeah I think overall it would be better and I don't think it's I think people should consider other people consider others and think of how it would actually be more beneficial rather than you know hurting them
1	I guess would it effect the medical people people actually in the medical profession
0	I think it does I think I remember watching um when I took a health careers class they're actually really showed canada and their nationalized healthcare I think there's other countries to i can't really remember who also have it but um they were saying how there's just a general pay so like there's not really you know how cardiologist get this huge amount of money or compared to a general doctor yeah so if those prices go down i think yeah haha um yeah those prices become a little i don't know exactly if they were to apply to america i don't know exactly how they would work it out economically but i that i think that's how they do it in canada where or other places with nationalized healthcare is that since it's you know kind of for everyone then there's not that much money that had you know that's expected from the person because it's coming from the government so it means the doctors don't really get much it's kind of like a don side
1	oh yeah
1	[..] centralized
1	uh doctor's won't like that
1	true that like i
1	no but if i told you learn that if offer someone like a huge sum amount of money to do something their like production or how well they do goes way down because they're like oh if i mess up i'll loose all this money oh no and then that makes them stress out and they mess up more i read this thing in india where they gave them like a ton of money for this one thing average and below and that average below actaully a lot better because if they messed up it's not that big of a deal it's not like it's like a ton of money their going to loose but i guess [..] then again they might get angry they don't get as much money and they don't do as well but there's
