0	okay well I do not know I it is kind of tricky but I think it should be I think it should be legal but I do not think it ever really will be. so
1	why do you think it should be legal?
0	well because compared to other drugs like prescriptions or alcohol it does not really have any like it is addictive but no more so than I feel like other things. I think that other things you can put in your body that are legal that would hurt you more than marijuana. so I do I do not like I kind of see both sides but I just kind of feel a little bit that should be well should be legal. I do not think it ever will be just because of the stigma it has but I think it should be.
1	well I think it should be illegal because I feel like it can do damage to your body like any other drug it can like of course if you use it a couple of times maybe it will not but like you use it more often and then all of a sudden like you are just addicted to it it can damage your brain. because I know I learned in psych last semester like I think it has some corellation to schizophrenia but I am like I do not have like any any um evidence on it.
0	I think that is yea that there is a lot there is a lot of I think it is like the war on drugs has been around since you know for a many years and I do not think there is a a lot of conclusive evidence one way or the other so we do not part of the problem is we really do not know what you know psychological or you know the effects it is going to have. but I think we do know the effects you know alcohol has. you know um oxycontin you know um other prescription there drugs that are known to be addictive and cause brain damage we know that. and we know these things can you know can kill you potentially. and like any other prescription you can get a marijuana card and use it. um I think that is you know I do not really know personally like what what what to choose but I would think that I would lean more towards legal just because there is a lot of over the counter things there is a lot of substances that are readily available that you can put in your body and that will kill you and that we know that you will get addicted to them if you continue to use them. I think that the jury is a little more out on marijuana just because we do not we do not it is um we do not know as much about it and and it is obviously illegal so there is not a lot of widespread um data the way there is with alcohol and other things you can get over the counter but um. yeah I think that for I know I just know from my what I know about it is that it is not as harmful or to me I do not think it would be as harmful as something like alcohol.
1	the effects it has
1	to choose? yeah.
1	is a drug
1	I think that it has to be like proven first also. that is the only reason I think it should stay illegal because like I think that more science has to do with the effects that it has in the brain and the body. because I do not I personally do not know the effects it has on your body. like I just know the effects mentally. and then like I think that like children. because I know like honestly let us be honest the people that do smoke marijuana are usually like high school to like college because you know parties and stuff so it is easier to get to drugs or whatever. but then it is like should you really think about it how it should be should it be illegal to a certain age limit? should it be twenty one and over? stuff like that.
0	yeah that is that is that is another
1	so you have to think about that.
0	like I just think the fact that it is illegal now creates these you know more shady avenues for kids to get you know marijuana. as opposed to if it was legal it would be more you know held to a different standard the way cigarettes are and all these other things that we know are um no more harmful than we have we have um measures in place and other countries have measures in place to um to prevent you know kids from getting ahold of these drugs. and I do not I think there just there is other countries that have it legal have it legal and have not done any you know research but I do not think there is you know
1	is true
1	I think that they also use it for um I think I do not know what religion it is but I think they do it to connect with the spirits or something in like other countries.
0	Yeah something something like yeah. But I do not I do not think there is enough um evidence from you know places who have it who have already legalized that it is caused any major um social social problems. It is not I just think I feel that marijuana is different from something like cocaine where you know it could it really causes problems and potentially one use could you know change change yeah
1	and then another thing is say we do make it legal and then like people begin to lace stuff and then like like if I am smoking marijuana with you and I lace it and then I can drug you up or whatever and I can put stuff in it
0	yeah well like I I I get that like that that that that already that already happens though yeah with alcohol and with with with marijuana especially when you are not getting you are getting it from you know some guy you do not really know and you do not know for sure what is in it. anyway I think that if it was legal you would and you bought it from a reputable semi-reputable or more reputable than you would get now that you would have a little more peace of mind that it would just be marijuana instead of you know who knows what he is trying to do with or cut it with anything to make money. you know you just you have a little more sense of um you know this is just what I bought you know?
1	Yeah so that is my concern
1	with alcohol also that is true
1	yeah I think the only thing like until until there is research proving like then maybe it is going to be legal but like you said I do not see it either.
0	*yeah. there is. yeah I
0	I do not I I do not I do not and that is just that is part of the problem is that a lot of people just do not know. and you can not really make a decision.
1	because I think it is because it is a drug.
0	It has it has a yeah.
1	that is my thing it is a drug.
0	It is a it has got a it has got a stigma to it that I do not think it really falls in I think people society kind of places it with in the hard drugs when I do not think it is necessarily like that.
1	Yeah because I know in I learned this semester that my teacher in cognitive science that we learned about the drugs and the effects it has on you. and then like um I know that marijuana and heroin have some kind of like similarities. of course heroin is worse but it is like the but is supposedly the same effect but like marijuana is not as damaging as heroin is. so I think yeah like you said just need to be research on it but yeah to prove the pros and the cons of weed or marijuana
0	yeah I think it is I think it is uh kind of a mute point almost because even if we were to legalize it in california it would still be illegal federally so could not it does not it does not really almost does not really matter until the it gets legalized you know throughout the entire country. or because whatever we do here it would still be a still be a a offense. still be illegal yeah.
1	*nation? yeah.
1	and think I think is still is like just like just I do I do not like smoking either like the just regular I call them cancer sticks. so like even that like the whole marijuana thing around kids too. so I just think all smoking should be just illegal but yeah but yeah that is the thing with the kids and then growing up with that. and then like like you said it needs to have an age limit too. like it is just question it is a question big question right?
0	*yeah. yeah.
0	yeah that is there is there yeah it is definitely a question mark. because I mean tobacco is obviously never going to be illegal it has been in the country for
