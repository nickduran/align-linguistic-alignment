1	so our topic was whether or not the drinking age should be lowered from twenty-one to eighteen
0	right I personally feel that the drinking age shouldn't be lowered because okay my reasoning behind this is okay there's many reasons okay if you think about it from the cognitive perspective level people aren't fully developed yet but from them biological as well if you think about it people aren't really developed yet you know from the age of um below eighteen and some people even continue on to the age of twenty-two we have what are called like soft spots in our head at least that aren't close up yet and I suppose that's one way to tell um everyone develops at certain rates usually a girls matures faster than men um men develop a little slower I guess um so by the age of twenty-two maybe some people aren't still quite develop yet so I don't think that that should be a thing you know I mean it's only a matter of three years to be honest you know on the other hand if we do quote on quote decriminalize it I feel like you know it really wouldn't even make that much of a difference becuase people all the way from down to even fourteen you know are getting a hold of drinks you really easily you could go to your local bum from underneath like the street shelter and be like hey can you buy me some I will give you an extra dollar or someting and that's how they do it
1	I think from considering my experience that the drinking age shouldn't be lowered because even now when we're 18 and we're considered adults many of us in college we can't handle it and it's something that we can't we don't we take when we get the power to be able to become an adult and make our own decisions we feel we have to drink to an extent where we can't remember that night and I feel like 18 year olds you know considering the fact that we're just adjusting to the adult life we're not responsible we can't handle the ability to not drink if given we even know that we we're not allowed to we take advantage of it and use it irresponsibly so imagine if we were allowed to use it it would be
0	uh huh
0	so if we were yeah if there wasn't decriminalized then yeah becuase that's one way to look at it because right and so I feel like that's one way that that's definitely one way as you were saying you know people quote on quote excuse the french like to get shit faced because you know that's one way to validate oh I drank so it's kind of just having your own like college bucket list kind of thing and people always feel this pressure to drink in college always feel this pressure so by lowering the age down to 18 I really don't think that your going to make any progress you know if people want it people will go get it people will supply it you know that's all that matters I guess it supply and demand thing
1	they'll probably go over board
1	ha ha
1	yeah I feel legally you know we're not even at that level of being we're not mature enough to to handle alcohol not even handle it but to know your limit to when to start when to stop this is the time where you adjust from your not 17 your not teenagers anymore your adjusting to a different life where your able to your own decisions just because you make your own decisions doesn't mean that your allowed or you should
0	to handle alcohol
0	a different
0	yeah and the use of alcohol so really has long term effects for example if you start off from let's say for the sake of this argument 18 you know you don't um you know a sort of sickness like alcholism or [eteressia] or any other kind of liver disease to kind of um grow on you that wouldn't even have to be developed in the first place you know if the drinking age wasn't lowered that low you wouldn't have even started that you would have never even you tried it because whenever you impose your restrictions like that it makes it more difficult so I guess in that sense you really really have to want it alcohol inorder to go get it well it's so easy to access they still have to want to get you know we can't just go up to the liquor store right now at the age of 18 or even 19 or watever and be like hey get my two fourties and you know I'll take the uv in the back you know
1	you know sometimes I think that the adults have a very strong influence on whetheror not 18 year olds drink because there are some liquor stores where you can enter and just to make profit or money out of it the liquor owners do sell alcohol 18 year olds and they kind of influence the kind of behavior that shouldn't be shouldn't be because they're like oh no it's okay you know your parent don't think it's okay but I will sell it to you
0	yeah that's one way I and that's why um there such high fines for um places like that in fact most places that do that especially if it's a liquor store um opun notifying the authorities and them conducting an investigations if they find out that you did that you close shop like that there's no if or buts they shut you down um and you know still going back in retrospect to the whole oh don't give it to 18 year olds um you know alcohol also really had adverse effects um regardless of whatever age it is um if your 18 21 40 it's going to affect your body in a negative way you know I guess in ways you know where you have your cup of wine a day or every other day you know that's a plus because [wine is full of antioxidants] and very subtle benefits but when your chugging down you know like 20 shots of vodka you know at a party and your half naked that's really not the way you want to go about these things that will really impact you I know and not even that biologically it will age you faster you know you'll be more prone to um diseases you know it's just bad news aside from just promoting alcoholism it's good to know to just step back that alcohol is just bad for you
1	it make you look bad
1	and a part from what beer does to you physically it also makes an appearance look bad you know not over 18 or now that 18 year olds have that age where your an adult even then they're not like I said before mature so they act very immature and adding you know like beer and alcohol to that makes them look even worse they look childish and it's a really bad appearance you know it's not college [yolo] it's no you look really bad
0	right you know and um if you also want to go about this from the statistical perspective the age group that has killed the most people under the influence of alcohol marijuana and you know just a buch of other ridiculous substances all acrros the categories have been the eighteen year olds all the way to the twenty-one year olds that has been the deadliest
1	and again because they can't handle it
0	exactly your not responsible for it you know you go out to the world thinking that oh I'm the collest thing ever and stuff and I want to prove something to myself and I want to feel like I'm older and that's just the thing with the generations of this age
1	yeah and I understand like sometimes now that from my perspective and my experience you know considering I'm young I feel like I can take on the world whatever choice I make right now or could make you know defines my future but you I don't think alcohol is one of those positive ones in fact it's going to like reduce
0	yeah you never
0	you don't want to procreate that you don't want to perpetuate this alcoholism like I said earlier you have something to look forward to in the future you don't want to give it all up for a couple shots of booz you know there's no point in doing that you can do that later in life if you want
1	yeah I thin alcohol is a thing in the moment but it's not something to look forward to you know it feels good like I've you know I've talk to several individuals they oh I don't like the taste of alcohol or liquor or beer any other substance that;s you know under that category but eventually after I take a couple of drinks I like the way I feel so nobody actually likes it they just like how it makes you feel and it's that feeling only last for such a small amount every time I feel like it's a waste you know
0	[for example]
0	it's not really worth it in the end of things especially when you get caught or when you hear these stories with people you know getting into fatal car crashes you know it kind of make you take a step back in retrospect and be like wow that's really not worth it at all so it's like why would you even want to do that in the first place you like what's wrong with you yeah
1	it's not
1	and it takes an effect on your education as well you know you know several like I'm talking from the perspective of college students you know rather than people who don't go to college but I feel like fro the perspective of college students the more you drink and the more you party and of this your not really focussing on what your here for which is your education and it has an effect on that as well
0	right so like yeah it doesn't really matter like yeah it's not important it's it shouldn't be important but some people it is you know sometimes partying is more important than your grades or you know addiction becomes your life and that shouldn't be or you get off to a bad start and it's just all bad news from there
1	and again from the irresponsibility factor they think they could handle it you know they think they can handle drinking and partying and school and work all
0	uh uh*
