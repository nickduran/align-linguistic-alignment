0	Do you oppose it?
1	I agree with it.
0	I agree also.
1	Okay $
0	What's your reasoning?
1	Um well, it's a way of life or it's a choice let you know whatever they decide whatever they want to call it I really don't care um everybody has the right to do whatever they want you know like it's a free country, do it. Um, I'm all for it obviously but yeah and they deserve the same rights.
0	That's practically my point yeah pretty much.
1	Yeah and I mean like you know we pretty much went through this already too right with like the Jim Crow laws and all of that stuff like right? And I mean African Americans ended up getting their liberty and everything I mean and this is I guess our problem for this generation, gay marriage. And and we will I just you know it's been a long time coming. We're slowly doing it so, yeah...
0	Eventually we'll get it.
0	hm. I'm trying to think...well it's practically the same thing like, it's their choice love is love like you can't change that. You can't change who they are who they how they feel about someone just because they people may think it's wrong.
1	Yeah. I also don't like the idea of people wanting to change the word marriage for them, right like partnership they don't want to call it marriage because they define marriage as a man and a woman. And I don't like that either I mean they like the idea of marriage then it should be called marriage for them too.
0	oh yeah
0	. Hm...I know the a big issue they had um around gay marriage they um always said like it doesn't say that in the bible like that's accepted but they don't mention that at all don't they?
1	In the bible I don't know I don't read the bible.
0	I don't either but I'm pretty sure...I'm pretty sure they say that they don't say anything about who it is, or who it can't be with
1	# I'm not religious
1	My bad.
1	$ um, yeah yeah I wouldn't know about that um I have heard that a lot right? That it says in the bible that it's an abomination and what not. I don't believe it I don't read the bible I don't care if it says it in the bible um it's something that was written how many years ago? $ like right things change um and if I just hate that religion gets into a lot of this I don't think it should. Religion causes too many problems in my opinion. So I think the topics should be separated but unfortunately they are not. So yeah I don't know I mean, gay marriage shouldn't even be a problem that's all my point.
0	yeah that's true. I know there's other things to focus on than gay marriage...it's something to talk about but it shouldn't be this big of an issue where there should be like riots, protests out on the streets.
1	I know. It's kind of embarassing to see the country do that.
0	Yeah looking at it from outside having that issue on like the cover of the newspaper but, there's such things
1	I mean other countries out there already have you know gay marriage implemented.
0	. Um...
1	But yeah all I know all I want like I mean all this country needs is just to progress, you know it's just progression and people get used to it. And no one liked the idea of the African Americans having their rights and now it's normal and in our children's generation gay marriage will be normal and then who knows what problem they will be s hh you know trying to solve at that point.
0	That's very true.
1	Is there anything else? $
0	Pretty sure just that. I'm trying to think of something.
0	Well some States are going close to accepting it.
1	And I think Hawaii just did.
0	New York doesn't it allow right?
1	Pretty sure a lot of the eastern east coast states do.
0	Yeah...but I don't know if this actually really means anything but other people that don't live in New York I know a lot of people that traveled to New York oh yeah and traveled to New York to get married but then I remembered it was a big issue about how if you returned back to the State that doesn't allow it then you're not really married and that was another big issue that they had with it.
1	don't know about that but yeah that's pretty dumb because people get married in different states all the time.
0	That's for sure actually $
0	Another thing about that um like the couples that are traveling all the way to like the States that do allow it pretty much just proves how much they actually mean it their marriage because they're going to go and travel just to do that one act.
1	they want it yeah
1	Exactly I see no point in holding it back from them right? I mean they're going to get it done anyway they already live together they already go out together I mean what's the difference? They just want a title to it they want to have you know the same rights that everybody else does. I don't see why that annoys people or angers people too much or at all.
0	... I do not know about this but um you know how some people get eloped is that doc documented?
0	It is? Okay, I was just going to say they could get eloped.
1	Yeah but still it's you need all the marriage certifications and all that
0	Nevermind then.
1	But yeah I just think it's ridiculous to try to impose something onto a group of people, or you know
1	Listening about how they
