participant	content1	I will start.0	yeah go ahead1	I do not I do not think I think the war in iraq like I do not I just I do not see the point in it honestly. like I am trying to figure I am still trying to figure out what is our purpose of being over there what are our soldiers why are our soldiers over there? like what are I am still trying to figure out what are we fighting for. and I feel like it is a big waste of time0	well we have been in the middle east for before the war in Iraq. and in the middle east. then desert storm and probably before that and. since so we already have it ever since we got rid of the shahs I mean we have we have had a presence there whether it has been the war in iraq or. just because for you know. to an extent we need to know what is going on over there because it does not just affect us it affects the world. um after nine eleven we were kind of put in a sticky situation because if you do not do anything you look weak and if you do something we have the war in iraq. um but I think that it was something that we kind of had to do because we are the maybe not the biggest but the probably the wealthiest and the most um influential countries in the world I mean like united nations has basically I feel the united nations should just basically tell the united states what to do and when we need help or when some other country needs help so. I think that from the standpoint that we had to do something you know to show that you can not just fly planes into the biggest city in the united states and nothing is going to happen was kind of necessary. um from a purely from a um political perspective. and also from you know a homeland security perspective because that is where you know where we thought at least al-qaeda was at the time so that made sense at the time. um if that needs to be reevaluated I think it probably does. because of the you know the money and the lives we have thrown at a problem that we have not been able to fix really since before that even happened but um. I think it was the right thing to do at the time definitely. um1	yeah now I think it was the right thing to do at that time but I think now it is just like how many years later and I feel like I mean I personally do not know what they are doing over there. like I am not there so I can not really say like I can not I do not have any evidence you know? but I just feel like they are over there killing people that did not do the whole thing. I feel like they captured who they need to capture so why like why are there?0	well when whenever you just go into a country it obviously there is more issues than just you can not just go in and shoot up the place and then not try to at least kind of fix what you have done that is kind of I do not think that is that aspect was really um in the mindset when we were starting into it. but I think that the our presence there was necessary afterwards because of the collapse of um you know saddam hussein and um you know we had to make sure that they could protect themselves and start a legitimate government. well what we think of as a legitimate government. um whether that was the right thing or the wrong thing morally is you know debatable but I think from politically from where we were standing that was kind of what we had to do because um when we when you dethrone someone who is like who kills people in soccer stadiums. um and again this there is um many issues in this war in iraq it is not just you know what happened. but when once you go in you kind of get tangled into all of these like we have had we this has happened to us before we got tangled into all of these things so it was a little surprising that we volunteered to do that again but um. once you make the decision to go in you kind of have to go all in or else you um you just kind of leave a society of people out in left out to dry when you have made your point. um I think from a again from a security standpoint it was um the right thing to do. obviously there is debatable whether it the right thing to do for the people. personally I think it is. I do not think there was a lot of people that enjoyed that despite what you may here or read I do not think that was I do not think that was a very um that it was good for people. yeah.
