0	yeah I mean legalize marijuana right yeah
1	I think they should legalize marijuana I mean I feel like it's if you when you when it's illegal it just makes a whole bunch of problems people are going to find a way to get it anyway people are going to find a way to get it illegally so what's the point I don't really see a point I don't smoe marijuana but I understand where other people are coming from and like there's just too much going on anyway
0	yeah and then you can make money off of it too right I mean taxing it all that other stuff
1	exactly I think it would be a little bit official than actually making it illegal
0	yeah I mean it helps to like medically wise right so I mean even if like someones a patient in a hospital you know they need to relax or other purposes like cancer too doesn't it help the cancer as well? yeah so I that's true
1	I mean why make it harder for them?
0	mhmm yeah yeah right it's gonna be on the streets anyways so
1	yeah I mean I feel like people are just the same with other drugs they find illegal ways to get it they just get in trouble for that so especially since marijuana is not like a like a huge drug where like you don't like go and die or something so I mean like it's not that big of a deal and people are gonna do it anywaywhether you legalize it or not it's gonna happen
0	mhmm anyways we get the most out of it for the country right like for anything
1	so I mean make high tax on it everybody benefits I think it works out that way
0	that's true mhmm
1	I know I'm thinking compromise already and I don't know
0	and then it's different from the other drugs like you said like it isn't it doesn't really kill them like alcohol there's drunk driving I mean
1	It doesn't kill you I mean
1	exactly so I mean marijuana whatever same thing same thing
0	yeah that's true
1	I don't know what else to say
0	yeah um how are we supposed to oppose this to other people right so we could argue
1	so other people would probably say well they should keep it illegal because kids are using it it's kind of a big issue with the young people and it still gets people in trouble I guess because what is if it is legalized people it's probably gonna be more of it that's probably what they're gonna say like more people are gonna use it it's gonna become a huge issue because everybody's gnna be high all the time not true but everyone's gonna be high all the time and I feel like they don't have enough arguments though because I think there's more reasons why it should be legalized than illegalized other than oh it's a drug which is probably gonna be mostly their argument it's a drug so it should be counted like all drugs it should be illegal
0	yeah too and I mean then if they legalize it too then they would have more like more leeway on the way they regulate it and the wy they like the cops can go about right I would think so
1	again free will people should do what they want to and then die as long as it's not effecting you in any type of way cause I mean there's marijuana shops everywhere especially in southern California
0	and then people have their own tastes too like people like there's still people that don't do it that don't give in to yeah
1	yeah there's still people who aren't gonna do it and then there's people who are gonna do it so whether you legalize it or not it's gonna be 2 different people doing 2 different things so it's not like it effects everybody yep it works out that way no one understands us we're the only smart ones around here i mean I don't know I figure maybe it's because they have like drug cartel issues and so they're like oh make it illegal for everything which yeah some drugs should be illegal but marijuana is not like that big of a deal yeah there's not that many high I mean like yeah sure I just feel like I'm gonna shoot you over some marijuana I mean like don't get into that like it's not that big of a deal I mean I know some people wo are like um that's cool but I'm not one of them I jsut feel like it shouldn't be illegal for the reasons that we just explained so I think it's fine [...]
0	gonna be there
0	uh huh
0	like the high risk factor drug
0	yeah yeah yeah same here
0	that's true
0	for real
1	I don't know what would cops say?
0	I don't know
1	I don't know I feel like there's some cops that to it themselves
0	that even do it themselves
0	oh probably get off work and you just want to relax like
1	yeah I mean helloI'm pretty sure they want it legal too come on now I just don't understand like uh I feel like you're not gonna really I mean yeah everybody kind of knows what a marijuana plant looks like but if someone wants to grow the marijuana plant let them grow it like it's their plant same thing as a garden put it in you garden maybe it looks pretty like maybe you just want it there I feel like it I don't know that it should be legal planting your own plants pretty sure that's legal marijuana included
0	I know right it's not your responsibility in the end
1	yeah it is your responsibility we should probably do that if like they're gonna make it legal or illegal it should just have like a responsibility factor not like oh it's a drug factor I think it should they should take into account what the risks are of the drug and stuff like that whichis not that many but they should take like account for certain things before they actually make it legal or illegal but I don't know I think it should be held responsibilit kind of thing
0	yeah same thing with medicine like how they even put the labels like do not operate heavy machinery like you know like that they could tell like do not do this like yeah
1	exactly like just put a warning on it like
1	it's all they have to do I guess or it's a pretty simple topic um I don't know I don't know what else the opposing team would say I mean it's bad for you
0	oh it kills brain cells
1	I guess yeah but again that's like
0	but then that's controversial too because people say it also helps build new ones so I mean there's like two sides to it in the end
1	And then again it's still those people versus you it's not like you have to do it or anything like that so I guess It's still whatever I don't know I haven't like last time I like really looked up stuff about marijuana was like probably like for some school like research thing or like if somebody talking about it reandomly kike at school or something but yeah I know there's always like controversy over like the health benefits and health deficits and so I don't know but I think maybe the ehalth benefits more outwiegh it a little bit more since it's not like the other drugs where it's like a bunch of chemicals and things like that it's like and herb
0	that's true that is true it's not comprised of like a bunch of different things it's just
1	exactly unless you like poured some chemicals on the soil and let it grow like in radioactive sewage or something now that's different but I mean like it's more like an herb it's not really like it's gonna kill you or something like that obviousy maybe not heavy usage of the drug where you walk around lookin stupid but but I mean in moderation it should be okay I mean like since I come from so cal like I've seen like a lot of marijuana shops and stuff in LA and those people don't look crazy like they're perfectly normal and I'm sure they they have to go to work and things like that and that's probably
