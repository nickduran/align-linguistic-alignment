0	so I believe that abortion should be illegal just because your you shouldn't have control over your a beings like that so like it's unjust to be able to just like kill your baby just because you feel like your unfit to take care of it because there's tons of other people that will take that baby off your hands once it's born that's the whole entire potential for another life
1	okay I agree I think it's um it's wrong and that uh well that your taking a life because you feel that you can and it's not up to you I think
0	yeah like it shouldn't be in your hands like just because just because your pregnant or having a child doesn't mean you have to if you if you are unfit to take care of it doesn't mean you have to like there are plenty of couples that are married and unable to concieve which they would easily provide a better life for that child rather than just have an abortion and that's where it ends
1	Yeah I think there are so many other options other than abortion that you can take
0	exactly like like abortion shouldn't be an escape route it shouldn't be and option at all
1	um and
1	hm um I think abortion now is kind of used like birth control and I think that that's not it's not something that should be done just because you made a mistake you shouldn't take the life of something
0	yeah that's true I never I never really thought about it like that so yeah like it is an extreme form of birth control that's completely unnecessary because if you were to use birth control and other things like that correctly you wouldn't have to have an abortion and abortion is just you trying to fix a mistake it's just an alternative marker so yeah but like the [...] I think is wrong just because because someone is pregnant and their having a baby like it's just that babies want this whole entire life their whole entire life and like have so much potential like that kidcould have the potential to like find the cure for cancer or for aids or become the next president and change the whole world and once you have that abortion that's one it's like decreasing the chances of change in the world
0	okay um I know that one of the main arguments to be pro choice is that if a women is raped and they have that child there forced to I once heard somebody say like every time they look at that child there going to be reminded of that accident well like I said earlier just because your pregnant doesn't mean you have to keep that child, exactly it has nothing to do with him or her so say in that senario a woman was raped no matter what having an abortion or not having an abortion isn't going to change the fact that she was raped but it does change the fact that your killing another human being and I know another argument is that they say people who are pro choice say that um it's a female's body and if she wants to have an abortion then she should be able to but even though it's her body it's another beings life so I mean I guess like if if it was up to that child to have an abortion or not to kill himself I doubt he'll choose to have an abortion so I think it's unjust to give to put that child's life in someone else's hand who clearly is unfit and wants an abortion
1	and it's not the child's fault
1	I know they debate about um the rights of the child because they're debating when life starts and I think that as soon as it's conceived like that's forming life and so that's a life that their taking and that's harder
0	exactly like they say like I don't know exactly what point it is where like it's actually like a being but as soon as it's set in motion like it'll eventually be a living thing from the point of conception so no matter what your doing it's harder
0	what are other arguments?
0	you go first
1	okay um it was that it's a life that um that it has it's own rights and it isn't it's not someone else's choice to take that life away and um
0	my main argument is just that um just because you feel that your unfit or even if you are unfit to take care of your child doesn't mean you have an abortion there like I said there's plenty of other options plenty of other people that will give that like that child a life it deserves and needs, it is its murder
