0	are you first or what?
0	are you against it? or
1	for legalization? I am for it.
0	so you are saying yes to legalization?
1	yes. and you are saying no I presume.
0	okay okay you start now
1	you can go.
0	you start.
1	ok. well I think that marijuana should be legalized
1	because like why not cigarettes? tobacco is legal and marijuana does less damage than that.
0	but then there is still I mean I am not take drugs I do not like know the effects on it so I mean. I discussed this in my like high school before. so we have health ed as a class so if marijuana is legalized then will we just make like the teacher just gonna tell the students hey marijuana is legalized. so that means telling students this is legal. that means everyone from like or like k through twelve like from like kindergarden gonna know that it is legal they are gonna start taking it? like it is bad for them. it is still bad for them there is still effect on it and like yea it might be legalized just because it does not have as much a strong effect as the other like
1	how old do you have to be to smoke cigarettes? eighteen right? I believe to purchase cigarettes. so it would not have any effect on kindergardens obviously.
0	eighteen right? yeah.
0	yea but then there gonna no it is still a statement for them knowing that drug is legal like it is really to me like I do not think those things are legal at all because like even until I am eighteen I do not think it is legal supposed to do it like it is just. anything that is bad for your body I go against it ok? because it is still going to damage your brain just not as much. and you how (______) likes like drugs that stop your like body from like keep going and stuff like that so
1	then why is alcohol and tobacco legalized? why do not they make it illegal? so if that if that is legal why can not marijuana be legal because I know of lots of people who do marijuana and they are perfectly capable to finish their academic work. a lot of them are really smart people. so it really does not have any effect. just like people who smoke cigarettes. uh they smoke cigarettes you do not automatically assume oh that person is
0	not automatically but they can die off from lung cancer in the long term
1	but that is that is their choice they if they know the side effects of it and they should be aware.
0	even if like and in class like if a relating to health classes we even say like drugs are like are we do we just automatically assume drugs are legal? like even till this stage I do not think drugs are legal or like alcohol and stuff like it is legal but it is not something I would prefer to do and it is not everyone is is going to do it. Like there is people who really never done it like me like I never done anything. it is just like to me like those are not I guess when I was raised too like how I look at things was just like that is not that is wrong like you are not supposed to do it and to change the concept like the next generation is going to think oh all this or whatever like they are legal then oh yeah I will do it it is like everyone is going to do it then. like would it be good for the next generation?
1	but but I mean I dont I do not do it myself either but I do not like it is it is yeah people are not people are not going to do it just because it is legal just because like when
0	they might
1	when they might exactly but when I have when I turn twenty-one I am not just going to go out and drink. crazy and you know do all that just because it is legal. and you know if people are already doing it now that it is illegal then
0	they will keep going but I mean
1	but it will only be the people who want to do it.
0	but then there is people who have the mindset they would not do something that is illegal like by the law. but then once they know that it is legal oh then why does not it hurt to try it then? like some people will follow the rules you know?
1	I do not believe that is true.
0	some people would like some
1	I do not think that like affects their mindset on it.
0	well some people might. again like it is their choice. so some people because it is legal now they might do it just because of that. so yeah.
1	but is that the only reason because it is the only reason you do not think it should be legal is because
0	because when you are educating the young generation your telling them it is legal it is just
1	Then what happened with I think it was the prohibition when alcohol was illegal. and then it then of course that did not last very long. what does that say to that generation then like oh well alcohol was illegal now it is legal. like it is the same mindset.
1	it people yes there are people who are you know abuse alcohol but not the whole world is abusing alcohol.
0	but then if you look at it like I am not sure of the exact statistics but then like if you look at it it is like definitely I believe before and compared to now like there is a lot of people doing alcohol instead of before just like because. also and another fact is it is legalized just I do not I do not know like just to me like something if it is leglized like I would think oh it is not wrong like it is not wrong morally. if it is not wrong then why can not I do it?
1	do you do you do you know people in highschool who drink alcohol
0	I I mean I never expected people to do it but then I guess like
1	but you know so it being legal or illegal did not affect their mindset
1	right? they were not like well I can not do this because it is illegal and then walk away. some people do not wear their seatbelt when they go down the street for you know to grab a bite to eat
1	and that is illegal. some people jaywalk and that is illegal. that does not stop them. so you are going to do it regardless if it is legal or not. it will it
0	not everything. not everything.
1	yeah not everything but. you know there are people like you and I who do not do it just because it you know will be harmful to our bodies so we are not going to smoke any time soon but that is those are the people who will not do it regardless of it is legal or illegal. so what is the real damage if we legalize marijuana?
0	well the real damage is to the whole drug and alcohol theories like to. I I am just really against it especially because health education is taught to like high schoolers and they have to take because it is for the general knowledge. like I do not pay attention in it and I feel really like bad about it. because that class can teach you a lot about like the next like a college like social life or stuff like that. and like telling them it is legal is just really
1	is tobacco a drug?
0	yeah I
1	so what difference would it be? because right like it says say no to drugs yet you see people walking down the street with a cigarette in their mouth.
1	what is the difference if you walk down the street and they have like a marijuana blunt in their mouth you would not even know the difference unless you could smell the difference. but you would not know the difference
0	I mean. okay you know how like now like people do like weed and then it is the same thing as marijuana right?
1	I I think so
0	Okay so like they put it into like whatsoever like brownie or whatsoever. then later on they just gonna go whatever they just gonna let it out. and then maybe like the whole streets going to fill with it. they are not going to hide it anymore because it is legalized
1	so like everyone is going to eat marijuana?
