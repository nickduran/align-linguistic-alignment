0	um I think no. because I think US should just like mind their own business do whatever they are doing in the US and that is about it. let other people live their life and follow their own rules.
1	I think that um it should be universal because there are people that can not afford the healthcare so it would be more beneficial for those who really need it.
0	um yes but um they can like help people who are only in the US and outside of USA it is it is not their business it is just they are only ruling united states hence they should only stick to americans or american citizens.
1	but what if they can not afford it? what do they do?
0	oh if american citizens can not afford it? then they can make um you know they can make options for them and it depends why are they getting sick because if you are just getting drunk all day and all night then it is not it is your own fault and I think you are old enough to understand that so if they are sick like that where they can not take care of themselves then um no USA does not have to waste their money on it.
1	but what if it is a situation where they do not have money and someone in the family has cancer and they really need help.
0	yeah then I think they should they should be helped.
1	so you so there should be universal health care.
0	in different cases. in different scenarios. but yes if someone is sick let us say if you just give birth to a baby who happened to diagnose with um mental issues of I assume the mother who has cancer she can not give birth to a baby because that would be just pretty much worthless. so uh a baby was born with something that mental issues or anything else then sure the government should help. but um if people have other you know other problems or if they are having diseases because they can not take care of themselves then it is their own responsiblity.
1	so you think only certain individuals should be helped and others should not? based on their circumstances?
0	yeah. their cases should be um read or interviewed um and then they should be achieving or receiving um healthcare
1	you you are more for towards no healthcare for now
0	no. they no no no that they should be helped they should have free healthcare but only to those
1	only to those who need it?
0	yeah. and if they are if they are coming from you know families who have worked hard and who works hard but they still do not have enough money to take care of the patient of the house or
1	they should be helped too right?
0	do you think everyone should get healthcare?
1	I think though I think to a certain extent it should kind of be equal.
0	does do we when we say health care do we um include birth control and all things like that? in healthcare?
1	are you saying that it should be included whether or not?
0	um I am asking. when we when you say healthcare.
1	um I I feel a little bit differently about that I do not feel like it should be necessarily offered I mean it is good that it is there. but sometimes I feel like it is more of incintive for like younger adults who are not as um who do not have education or more you know likely to like have intercourse and do things like that that would cause problems so I think because of that I would probably say no. but at the same time um it probably will not stop them.
0	I think um younger adults especially younger than eighteen um they should not they can have these things um like birth control but they should um be able to pay or it should not be in healthcare um how it what it is called
1	it should not be included?
0	yeah included in healthcare.
1	with that I agree
1	so how else do you feel about
0	healthcare? um um and I think people who are born with certain problems or diseases or like people who are asthmatic ever since they were born I think they should um they should be able to get free health because they are just born with that. whereas some people they can um they can they can get asthma they can start getting asthma or start being asthmatic just because they have been smoking cigarettes a lot. so they should not be able to get healthcare.
1	but how do you determine um who actually gets the healthcare what if they have asthma not because of genetics? what if it is because they are smoking? how do you determine that?
0	um you just simply ask them and trust them and have faith in them so they are not lying. #
1	# but what if they do lie then? what do you do then?
0	I guess then then you can still go back to their history and see that when they were born or like when they were really young let us say when they were five years old did they have asthma attack um when they were that young. and definitely we have health histories in our system hopefully.
