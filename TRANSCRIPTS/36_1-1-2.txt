1	uh I think I believe it should be
0	ok uh I think it should be legalized yeah
1	be illegalized? legalized?
0	yeah yeah yeah like illegal like they should get rid of the whole medical thing uh and everything
1	so why do you think it should be illegal?
0	uh because uh uh lots of reasons
1	haha though I think I mean for me I think before like maybe a lot of people I would be totally against it uh but I have met a lot of people that have been able to do so and people that like are taking it for like medical reasons and people that of course are just using it for the social aspects of it but uh I do not really I mean I think I feel like oh when people think of marijuana they have like that negative like stereotype of like oh it is going to make you slow it is going to make you this like you are not you know like it is a bad thing but I mean so many people use it and like so many people I would never have guessed that have like the best grades and are like really good that I know it has not like affected them in any way like some partially like that can not be like I can not say that for everybody else but like some people that I do know like that is like the case and I think that there is so much money that goes into it our like California would like really benifit from it and like just recently was like legalized in like Washington and
0	# haha
0	and Oregon and Colorado
1	Colorado so I think that would be interesting to see how that plays off there I mean maybe I could be completely wrong or something but I think like the money like in terms of like money we could like definately benifit from it uh but also I do not know like if like I do not know how that would work because I am pretty sure people would still find ways to like not like getting it from you know places where it would be taxed like still getting it from somebody else so uh
0	* yeah
0	* yeah
0	like uh yeah I totally understand it is like the safety issues there is definately like not a health precaution there is definately I mean when you look at compared to alcohol and stuff alcohol would be extreamly more dangerous and stuff like that with uh just in terms of trying to legalize it and how you would sell like tobacco and stuff like that like in a place like California like even if they made it legalized they would it would be out of control like it is right now there would be no way for everyone to insure you know there would have to be people going up to different farms different parts of the forrest knocking on cabbin or whatever saying you know do you guys doing this whole like are you doing this tax you know? because people are going to be growing all this marijuana it is going to be taxed and I think by legalizing it it would create I do not know an enviornment of culture of it being ok and therefore there would be all this sorts of marijuana in California and the west coast where most of it is grown you know? then it would be sent all over the world you know? then people would because that is already happening where like like you know tons of marijuana gets sent from the west coast to over to the east coast you know? and so by legalizing I feel like there would just be more pot being grown and then it would go to places like in Singapore where there is still the death penalty for like having a gram of marijuana people get hung for that still so I feel like that would just uh promote more crime and violence in other parts of the world even though on the individual level like here in California it may seem as something that is harmless and does not hurt people
1	* yeah
1	* yeah
1	* yeah
1	yeah and I know it has been I mean I I mean I could see it definately from other people's perspective they say could be like a gateway drugs or a gateway drug to other sort of things and I mean I am totally I am against I do not do drugs so I mean I am just speaking like for like the people that have done it that I know like they definately changed my perspective on it and I am just seeing it as like this uh not like oh accepting it is like a good thing so much I am more of like the financial benifits and even though like perhaps yes there is going to be ways of like you know not or getting marijuana through other forms and not like it being taxed there is still going to be more money than we have so uh and yeah definately and also I mean alcohol and tobacco like you said they are way worse and like there have been studies and it has not really no one has died on marijuana like you know like tobacco kills people from like lung cancer so like definately if anything you know? I I am against cigarettes but it is still out there you know? people people have tried to abolish uh alcohol and then you know that did not work out so like it is just something that is there and should be more taxed marijuana I do not know how they would do the taxes but I think you know? taxes
0	* yeah
0	that did not work
0	I think it still would get taxed and people like would you know like would some people would go to the store and buy their marijuana but I think the vast majority of marijuana smokers would get it from the same place they have always been getting it when so it would not really add it would add some but you know yeah so it would be it would be different but I also think like understand the importance of it being legalized but it would like what I said earlier it would just create the rest of the world is not ready for it to be legal
1	and that is some
1	yeah I guess it is because you know California is like more of a general acceptance for it but if you go to other places it is like what? and
0	it has got the negative
0	* yeah
0	yeah but have you ever seen someone from like that is from a different state and come to California and see people smoking marijuana casually and they are like woah you guys are just like you know smoking like nothing?
1	just so yeah how about like medical in terms of like medical for medical benifits
0	well medical medical system is like really like in California it is a lot different than it is in like Colorado because I know in Colorado before it got legalized they had it where it was like every patient like had like marijuana grown for them and everything runs through like serial codes like that as opposed to California where you can just go down to like any like two bit doctor or whatever that will like do that like in places like Modesto San Jose Fresno they have like two page spreads where it will be like just ads of all the different doctors and it will say like come here for fifty bucks fourty five and if everyone will we will beat anybody's price by five dollars and there are these doctors that like go to get their doctors degrees just so they can go hand out prescriptions for people that get marijuana so in that sense it is like it is already pretty much legalized really you just have to like do a little curve around and just get that yeah
1	yeah it is not hard at all to get that because I know lots of people that you know oh we are just going to
0	and it is not yeah these doctors like they only approve pretty much like the they type of person that come in there and be denied is a fool that is going to say something that nobody ever gets marijuana for it but yeah so in that sense like I also think like the reason that the system is like that so easy for people to get legalized and people to even start dispensaries and like cannibus clubs in California and it promotes like a lot more crime and violence around there like a lot of like club cannibus clubs collectives that are run by like gangs and stuff like that you know? and they are able to put up a collective like a non profit collective as like a way to like launder money and stuff like that and it is just like a front for them to keep criminal activity
1	yeah and I think I mean that I say that I am for it but uh and then I think of like the consequences that could you know if it is like legalized it will be like even more yonger children will be like oh this is something I could do and and not and not neccessarily I mean I do not think children should be doing that and there should be an age you know probably like twenty one where it is like legal for them but still I mean like alcohol the young children are they want to break the law you know they want to break the rules so they are going to want to
