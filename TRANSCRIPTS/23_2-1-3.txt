0	so what's your opinion on abortion?
1	abortion i think it's wrong because um okay so that you have a baby and you uh the baby doesn't have the fault that of being there of like having to exist so like pretty much your taking a life away without his fault i don't know
0	yeah I think that's true because um it's not a right to take away a life even if um you don't know how the life of the baby is if your unable to support it there are governmental programs that actually help the mother that could take care of the baby right? and um even after you give birthif you do not wish to keep the baby you can always put the baby into adoptions to find another more fittable parents right? so um yeah so i don't think it should be legalized either
1	to help yeah
1	another yeah to take care of
1	yeah it's um i just think it's like morally wrong in a sense because um i don't know like abortionis like even though you don't see the it's not like you don't see the baby it's like there is life inside of you so
0	yeah so even if something unfortunate happend prior to having a baby uh I think not giving the baby a chance is not goood because usually um you develop this relationship with the baby after you give birth so maybe by giving birth to the baby the mother could change their opinion right? because um it yeah who doesn't like babies haha yeah so i think i think after giveing birth um that's when your your able to make a proper decision on whether you want it because um usually unwanted pregnancy are usually happening in teenage kind of young age right? and at that time their not responsible enough to make the decisions so it yeah yeah and even if you can't you can't raise a baby your mom or your the grandma of the baby or whatever can help you take care of the baby so it's not like that much of a obsticle for you if
1	yeah yeah then
1	uh huh
1	you don'twant yeah yeah that's true
1	haha that's true
1	when you have a connection yeah
1	yeah uh huh
1	yeah and like they don't want a like if you think about it you don't want a baby at that age
1	uh huh
1	yeah and then there's many help like now and days because there been like a lot of pregnancies there's a lot of government helpand like um support for teenage moms yeah uh huh yeah yeah yeah
0	yeah yeah that's true yeah so you can always get help if you can't take care of the baby
1	um is there states that are legal like legalized abortions too in there
0	uh i'm not sure is california legalize abortion because um i remember i went to this um uh like program and there's this monk outside the door and he was protesting against abortion yeah yeah i think so it makes sense because uh the human body isn't just a body right? it has a soul yeah that's that's the reason for everything yeah and it's kind of wierd because um the office i went to the house office i went to they were saying like oh ignore the monk he doesn't know anything like whatever and i think that's kind of wrong you know because there's always two views to everything and they should respect it
1	um i don't know
1	oh religions is very against abortion yeah
1	uh huh
1	yeah that's true that's the way they see it uh huh
1	no haha
1	yeah there's like their own opinion their own perspective yeah and then it's like it should be respected to
1	yeah are they trying to legalize abortion like currently
0	i thin so
1	oh yeah i'm not sure i don't know
0	um because you know okay so people been arguing that after rapes and stuff um the mother is um emotionally traumatixed and they don't want to keep the baby but that's actually um i think a pill or something you can take after that like immediately after the event happend i think within thirty minutes or something if they if they can get help then um they'll be emotionally treat for
1	yeah that's true yeah
1	it's like yeah
1	because i think there's like factors that like that you can get abortion in some like it just depends on the situation the mother's in so i think if you get raped or like something like um not an unwanted its not an accident but like unwanted i think you you you could get an abortion i'm not sure i read something about but i'm not sure
0	really? i thought i thought i thought illegalizing it just mean like all together because there are pill you can take like after within like a day or two for you to not be able to be pregnant right? so technically the mother really has no excuse haha we're kind of being mean ha ha yeah so there are different options for them to take not like waiting until the last minute and then um get abortions and kill the baby yeah
1	but then yeah
1	after uh huh yeah yeah yeah i heard of that
1	uh huh
1	ha ha uh yeah that's true
1	uh huh
1	yeah but isn't it like kind of already well it's not formed yet right? like after like one day after or two days after? isn't that considered
0	no no it's not actually um i think it has to take about two two two days to actually be pregnant so you don't automatically be no yeah so yeah so that's not when the baby is formed so yeah but haha because if you you make a decisions whent the baby is already formed then why are you yeah if you know it's bad thing then why don't yeah
1	uh huh oh okay so it's not considered as abortion okay like if you abort i get it
1	uh huh uh huh
1	yeah that's true
1	if you if you know you don't want it then you you have like the option to like when they uh huh
1	that's true
1	so have you ever had like a family member that has aborted or no me either
0	oh no no yeah i know my aunt um had accidently baby but they decided to keep the baby anways yeah
1	yeah that's happend to my cousin i think
0	so i think it's it's pretty bad to get abortions
1	uh huh
1	there's like a lot of people believe in like that an abortion huh? a lot of people actually do it
0	uh huh
0	actually a lot of people don't think about it until it happens to them then they realize they debate over but usually people who um who are pro abortions they don't really think about the mentalities of the people who are rejecting it yeah yeah
1	uh huh
1	oh okay until like it happens to them or or do you think like they just abort and i'm pretty sure they have like a sentimental like oh i don't want to abort it they change their perspective
0	maybe maybe those people who are against abortion already have babies and they they know the emotional connections when the mother and the child and uh for people who want abortions usually they haven't had a child and they don't realize that until after they give birth but they decide not to give birth so yeah haha yeah so abortion is bad
1	uh huh
1	uh huh yeah
1	ha ha
1	mm abortion is bad yeah ha yeah i don't agree with it um is there like cultures that actually accept abortion?
0	uh i know my culture doesn't accept abortion i don't think yeah
1	yeah mine either
1	i don't think it does but do think there be like there are like out in the world you know
0	there are people who try to do like use natural remedies to get abortions like i have heard people taking mints a lot of them ha to try to prevent them from having baby like mint like the plant yeah i have no idea why but i don't think it works but a lot of people try to use natural yeah because i think sometime the hospital if you want to get an abortion you have to get a kinds of papers signed and then you get judged and stuff like that so
1	oh yeah
1	what what?
1	mint? really? that's weird i didn't know that
1	uh huh to abort uh huh
1	isn't it dangerous for the person for the female to
0	yeah it's very dangerous
0	but i guess they would want to risk that yeah
1	uh huh instead of like having a baby yeah
