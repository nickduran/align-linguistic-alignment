0	What did you think about the war?
1	um I am for the wars
0	are you for it? I was against it. Why were you for it?
1	well because they obviously bombed us on nine eleven and many people died. so like a lot of blood was shed and familys were killed parents and siblings and all for what
0	ok and I think I was against it because I thought that was not justified like they just go and they just bomb random parts of iraq even though did not know who where the guy was or who who actually did it. and it worsened the economy also they did not think about like oh they put the US in so much debt you know? and we are still trying to get out of it. so in in the case they suffered but we suffered over here too. and they suffered because well they obviously there many people were killed over there also. but we suffered here like economically socially our even our people like they went out for the war soldiers. those families are seperated you know? and like if that never happened like they would have still been at home. I do not know what do you feel?
1	well because we were they are fighting for our country we need protection we need to show the rest of the world that we are a strong um country. and in order for that to happen we need to like regulate and we need to like make sure they do not bomb other countries and do what they did to us to other countries. and so maybe it was kind of a way to like teach them a lesson in a way?
0	and yet the bombed the the train afterwards? like in england?
1	in england?
1	yeah like I think they did.
0	they did that and then I think they did one in india too. so it is like two three occurances too.
1	see exactly so we need to stop them.
0	they actually did not learn from the iraq war. so and then like like let us say like someone came like from canada or somewhere or whatever and they shot and they killed one of your family members you know? or whatever or you friends. would you go out and kill everyone from canada?
1	I would not kill anyone.
0	ok then what makes you think about we should go and kill them?
1	well why did they kill us? they were killing people here for no reason.
0	but did not we kill people over there too like in the nineteen ninties or something? like we were not killing the right people you know but we were still killing someone. like they came down here and they they they shot down the building or whatever they bombed the building. but we did not know who exactly who it was. but later we found out like we labled it al-qaeda or whatever. does that mean that we we go and we kill everybody there or we just try to like (___)
1	our intentions are not to kill everyone there we are just trying to get rid of all the bad people because they are doing they are not only doing bad things to other countries but within their own country they are corrupted.
0	but the method that george bush
0	yeah I get you but like have not I do not know if you have seen those videos like where those like US army they are just randomly playing games and killing people. that is the same thing they do at the mexican border too. like if you see them they are just they are like killing random people who cross the border
1	however that is within their own country this is um
0	but are not we part of the country?
0	are not we part of the country?
1	no I mean in mexico that is within their own country. this is between the united states and iraq. this is between two different countries and um just I guess trying to get even
0	because I know like the border patrol they just play random games. they be killing people unless they take it as like a they kill be like like a hobby. and that is the same thing they do over there too.
1	well that is not like what we want to do but that is their a personal choice. like if we are not sending them oh go over there and kill them and just play with their dead bodies were not telling them to do that. we are telling them what to do like you know just their job not to kill people for fun and play with their dead bodies.
0	yeah but how do we how do we regulate that though? because we have no control over what they think you know? we have no control over what the people think we just we are just hoping they do we are just hoping they do the right thing.
1	we have no control over it. I mean the united states is a strong country and that is why we are we were over there.
0	how are we strong? our economy is really down.
1	we have a we are our economy is down but we have a lot of um a lot of um we have a strong military
0	our our economy most of our economy is from
1	that is what I meant like a strong military
0	like we are we are doing globalization all of our mass production is produced in other countries. so how does that make us strong you know? and our economy is down like our we have forclosures and everything. so I do not think we are a strong country right now. we might act like we are a strong country. the president might just make a speech like obama he is a good charismatic speaker. he might make us think we are a strong country but I do not think we are a strong country right now. and like there is people out there leaders that like all they want is money you know? they want their own power. now that is what I think. and plus like the war has just put us in like economic crisis. the if we were going to go at get our oil reserves from the middle east the war just knocked that off too.
1	I was talking like military-wise that is
1	you do realize if were not in iraq there would be like chaos everywhere. I mean there already is but it would be even more because they would be bombing there if we did not do anything they would be like oh they did not do anything we are gonna just go bomb some other people.
0	what makes you think that?
0	but what did we do though? what did we do? we did not do anything either.
1	yeah but they are still bombing. but like we are over there to eliminate it.
0	like al-qaeda they could have done it to anybody you know? if they had done it to like
1	they do some cruel stuff to to their own people.
0	if they if they would have done it to like if they would have done it to like egypt or like one of the third world countries we would not have given it that much attention. it is just that I think like we wanna feel like we are like badasses and stuff and like we wanna go out there and show them. but I do not think it is the right thing you know? it is like ego over mind.
1	so what you are saying is we should not have done anything after nine eleven?
0	I think we should have I think should took more a more more intellectual approach and we should have like reasoned everything out and then gone there. instead of like bush and his policy to just to bomb everywhere like not a specific territory. just where ever he like felt like in. and plus like I do not know. I believe in like the conspiracy things. I felt like
1	what conspiracy?
0	like we did it like there was a motive behind it. we wanted to go over there and like start a war or whatever and like the the
1	so you believe like nine eleven was fake? is that what you are trying to say?
0	like I do not think it is fake. well it is obviously not fake because they bombed it but. I think like they put the lower class people or whatever into more debt and like even the top banks that the US had they made money off of the war. they supplied whatever all the military production. they made money off of it. so
1	but it is still providing protection for us. you have to put money into our protection into the military in order for like us to have a strong military. we need
0	well when when we need protection like in hurricane katrina or something when there is like a natural disaster
1	exactly that is why we have the national guard. we have that.
0	no we need like more you know? we need more people like helping us out like when they need it the most. like hurricane katrina or whatever the earthquakes that happen? like I feel like
