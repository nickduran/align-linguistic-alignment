1	Kill him? Um I would say so but then um like I would agree with that but I feel that there's certain ethical boundaries that we just can't cross um for the economic sense I feel that we could have um like basically have essentially free labor even though we are housing them and feeding them we don't necessarily have to pay but um the percentage of the work they do inside the prison so there are some benefits to um you know not killing or um I guess executing the death penalty? Just because um it'd be a waste of potential labor or
0	yeah but the labor thing but uh when we pay our taxes it costs like more doesn't it? Like when we pay our taxes uh like a lot of it goes to the prisons and stuff
1	well for as for the taxes I feel that it may be very minute because I feel because I know for a fact that the majority of our taxes does go to um, military spending about 55% of it is so the amount that actually goes to prison the prisons is very minute so I think anybody who's concerned about their taxes going to prisons should be more focused on their um their taxes going to the military um
0	I don't know. Otherwise it's like it's like um like I like that's like the only reason that I would be like um for it because the economic like the economic value? But otherwise I think I'd be against it because um like why would you punish someone for killing someone by killing them?
1	the whole eye for an eye thing?
0	yeah no
1	yeah and also I feel like there's that for any crime where only um whoever's guilty that we're only certain of it to a certain degree even with um like a confession like there could've been like certain um variables that could have had them like you know feel confessing to it all and um xxx guilty you know like we're going to do this so there's always those so like what if we accidentally killed someone who was not guilty of a crime at all just for being so black and white about the death penalty so that's why I feel it should be better safe than sorry even if they are in prison then we um just because we um a jury said that you know they were guilty of the crime but I I don't think the jury like um you know sentenced them to death
0	yeah like um we were watching this video in this like class and it was about this guy who got accused of rape and he was in prison for like 11 years and 11 years later they found out it wasn't him so it's like there's always those stories and then you're just like whoa
1	yeah and just um and applying that to like this um short novella like from the last um century it's called um 12 Angry Men where it just takes 1 person to change the perspective of the whole jury so they just took that 1 person that was falsely accused and falsely sent to prison to totally like switch the agenda of what it means to be like in prison and like on the on death row. So it's like we should have it?
0	yeah. How long do you have to isn't it like a while that you're on death row?
1	yeah you are you're on death row for a while
0	yeah some people like die while they're waiting $
1	but yeah again a lot of people end up I feel like will end up dying in prison just for like being violent like a prison is it isn't your you know typical Sunday playground
0	yeah. But then again there's always those people who like who go to prison just for like the health benefits and stuff because I've heard of that too because um my cousin works at like a cancer place and she said they like um they treat this prisoner like he comes like every 2 weeks for chemo and then like he's like said oh like I'm in prison so I can get like my chemo. Like so I don't know I don't know if he's on death row or anything but
1	uh huh
1	right so there are like some benefits to being in prison?
1	and then again if um a taxpayer's money do go to like paying for that person's um wellbeing well that's just the same thing as like Medicel or CalViva or you know any of those um social um welfare programs.
0	yeah. I don't know then you can always just there you could argue religion with everything $
1	yeah again you know if God is the one who was meant to take this person's life
0	yeah he would've.
1	he would've so the fact that they're like not dead is for a reason.
0	yeah this is kind of like uh this is pretty like straight on but I I don't know. Wasn't that up for um election this year?
1	yeah the whole to ban the death penalty in California
0	yeah the whole
0	I think so I wonder what happened? I didn't really follow up on it.
1	I don't think it passed because we are I think it's still on the fence
0	you don't think
0	oh okay. A lot of other states have banned it?
1	no and prisoners and because every state's different like like you have like the different opinions on um being under age you know? So it's uh they're state laws not federal laws # I think it's really it'd be very difficult to have a federal you know death penalty like the whole nation has to follow this idea
0	yeah that'd be that'd be $ ...Two more minutes? Okay.
1	so like for the people that were on death row like like what constitutes being on like death row like you know? What have what should you have done to be on death row?
0	isn't it like killing someone that's like you're on death row but isn't it like how you killed them or something?
1	oh yeah
1	possibly. Like if it was like because like like because like there's like manslaughter when you accidentally kill someone and then there's like homicide and then if you get homicide it's like 25 years like you xxx . Like that not even that but like like I don't think like they've advertised it like the whole death row the death penalty like you know they're like there are like I've seen like um public um like announcements you know 25 to life he but like less than again but like you don't hear like you know you kill someone and they're like they'll kill you in prison like I feel like that's just bad. I I think like even though um there is like the social like awareness that you know if you do this there is the chance that you'll go and see the death penalty or even that I feel like it would lose support very fast just because announcing to the public you know like the government is going to execute some human early today but I I think even the government and the people that support it are um aware of that so so like the fact that they have to be cautious about it in that way means that it's not very supported lots of people don't agree with it
0	25 to life isn't it? Or something
0	yeah but I don't know. It's like I think like the older people like that have like the older people they have like their minds set on it like oh death penalty because they like grew up around that I guess? Like with the lynching and all that so and those are the people that usually vote more so $
1	well I feel like they vote more just to keep their old um point of views into into uh effect. Like they
