1	I think we sh we should not lower the um legal drinking age because it's really harmful for our health and some people like will at the age of 18 they go to college uh some of them just learned how to drive and they drink after they drive after drinking like my friends um and they they got in an accident. It was really harmful for their life and education.
0	"okay. um the first part that you said about um it being harmful I think it it's not any more harmful for somebody who's 18 rather than somebody who's 21 um and you're right like it at the age of 18 a lot of people um make dumb decisions ""$"" as and alcohol doesn't make that any better but I I feel like it doesn't if the age if the age limit was lowered it's not going to um stop anybody from drinking because people all like you said 18 year olds are already drinking so I don't know if it'll make a difference at all"
1	uh I think when people grow up to 21 they will be more more mature than people when they uh were 18 so uh
0	like xxx. um
1	I think you said people in military they can lose their lives or like when they're at a really young age but that's a different case with the drinking yeah. I think they make their own decisions but they're not old enough to make a good decision like when their age like under 21.
0	"um um I guess so ""$"" let's see mm I know that like in Europe in France there is no drinking age like 5 years old you can drink alcohol ""$"" wine and uh it seems to work for them but I I feel like if if we were to lower the age right right away then 18 year olds who didn't drink um when the age was 21 might do it now that the age is lowered and for those few years you know right after that um it could increase like the like you said then uh people the younger people behind the wheel drinking and driving, etc. but after time when people get used to the idea that it is the age has been lowered then then it might go back down drinking and driving um"
0	xxx but I know that I have experience um people drinking and driving and yeah it's not a very good thing I mean even if people drink and drive all the time and nothing happens it doesn't matter because it can just be that one time when you can take that one life uh from people that might be in their car and somebody who's in another car but it is it's really dangerous. I don't believe that I mean I I feel I feel like it could be lowered but I don't think it's a huge deal like if it was lowered I wouldn't be like so happy about it and if it stays the same I don't care either I don't I don't think it's really that big of a
1	I think we just do like what we are like the age the legal age is 21 it doesn't make a difference but um kind of like when they tell us like teenagers' behaviors.
