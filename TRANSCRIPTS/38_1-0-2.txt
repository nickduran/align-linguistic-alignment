1	pro choice on abortion?
1	I I'm not so much pro choice I'm kind of um more like against it for the most part just because I stand behind the idea of um of uh like the killing of a child um is bad just in general and because of that reason like I understand like there's there are mothers who um are like rape victims that kind of thing and I understand that they are the victims but also um the punishing of the child which is the actual rapist in that sense um I'm not against it I'm not like I don't think that
0	uh huh
0	I don't know because um you know how like okay where was I going? Like if a mother can't really like provide for the child and then like let's say like you you're in Africa like why bring a child into the world when they're just going to like starve or something anyways so why like expose them to the cruelty? And like I'm not like you know how they do like there's different stages I don't I'm not for like you know how I guess it's like 3 months after when the fetus starts to develop and then they have the abortion in which if that's like I think that's bad because that's when like it's actually forming and stuff so like I guess if it's in the beginning stages then it's like okay but like I will I was like always like against it but then like as like as I grew up and like learned more and more stories of like people and where they came from I'm like more pro choice like it should really depend on the mother but I feel like you know how there's always like oh you don't have to tell the father, I think you should always tell the father because then that's like a means to like maybe if you don't want it he'll want it or you know? So
1	mm again what was I just saying like I just like I get that and I think you're only like pro choice only to a certain point only to like a certain point though that the fetus is developed because I like I have um like a bro not Mike or something so like I'm friends xxx that kind of thing like like their birth control like um like the morning after pill that kind of thing I have no particular problem against that just because like um. How inappropriate can we be? Because...just whatever? Oh okay. Just because like from a guy's per perspective just like rambling um but like like masturbation that kind of thing though I just you know ejaculated all those sperm cell you know like like I don't know but is that a bad thing? Like the wasting of sperm cells and then when a girl has her period you know that's just uh the waste of an egg cell that could have been a baby so I feel like those like day right after like a thing um it falls in the same boundaries just because it's not the it is a cycle but it's conceived but I wouldn't say yet it's a fetus so I feel like uh those early um um forms of birth control um are appropriate just because it's responsible in a sense like you know you uh you made a choice to have sex and the risk is getting pregnant but then you took um you you took care of it you know but waiting you know until your second trimester when you're already developing I think at that point it's kind of like uh
0	uh huh
0	uh huh
0	yeah because well like I I think it's really rare when people like don't know they're pregnant like most people like find out you know? So waiting that long I think that's just like irresponsible and it's like I'm against that but like as like you were saying the morning after pill or whatever like I'm for that because like you know? That's just like being responsible as you said.
1	so there there's certain aspects of uh the mother being responsible like um like again going back to like the rape victim you know I think waiting until you know several months after you've been raped to find out that you're pregnant that's uh again like I don't want to point fingers like you are the rape victim and like I have sympathy for you but then you also have to be a responsible adult about things
0	yeah. Like you should get checked like right after but I don't know it's still it's kind of a hard topic because like there's always those women like that get raped and they're like in a low poverty level and stuff you know so they like bring their child into this world and they're not even going to take care of it it's just going to live in slums and stuff so I don't I don't know if that's right either. It's like
1	yeah well everything again everything's in context and then to the extent of poverty because there's always like you kind of like um you know some celebrities today like you know they came from nothing you know? And okaying the murdering of that child you know uh they could have been something you know like you just possibly could have just killed you know our cure for cancer or you know so every everything's in context but like you know again like um the example you brought up about the child in Africa? I mean it's you know again that little African child could be you know our savior to cancer that kind of thing but um like if it's guaranteed like the child is going to like you know starve within like the first couple of months of being born then there's nothing really you can do about then I suppose then you know again everything in context
0	yeah and then like people argue like the God thing like oh God gave you life then God should take it away you know so I don't know like that's what that's how I am like I think we're pretty much on the same page where like it's good up to a certain point
1	but then the whole religious aspect like I um like I'm not particularly religious but um I'm very open-minded about things about that but um from the religious point of view the abortion one like I think straight down the middle from a religious perspective in being against it but uh um you can't take whatever religious sect whatever it is you know word for word verbatim just because I don't think they um it advances a society but um yeah I mean because like my gut instinct based on like a religious agenda you'd say no just like I want to say no
0	uh huh
0	yeah because I mean but like when you look at like all the other things that play along then it's like yeah...because so we have to go for 8 minutes?
0	oh okay
1	okay so I would be um not rationalizing to think that that some that I'm right. How we talk about the whole religious thing because I feel like we do agree I mean besides the like the ethical and like the you know about the the fetus and like being responsible about it but then from a religious agenda that one's like the hard one
0	yeah #
0	uh huh
0	well a religious agenda like pretty much that's like a no. If you look at it from a religious point of view like no on abortion you know? Like that's what that's what like I'm getting at you know like even looking at like different kinds of religions like they're all just like oh God gave you life God take it away you know so religious wise I think that's like a no but like when you look at it just like talking to someone not set their religion aside then it's like that's when people's opinions and all that
1	yeah but I feel like it's really hard to um uh like unjustify religion? So it's kind of like um because it says um you you abort your child on the basis that you won't be able to feed it right? And then like somebody could just say you know then you have no faith in God that you know that then they would have like provided for you and your child well damn so you know like you have faith in God and you keep the child but then what if um you or your child dies from starvation right that kind of thing then you know it's like you know it wasn't in God's plan to do that so it kind of feels like it's a catch 22 um about that
0	that you yeah
0	but then
