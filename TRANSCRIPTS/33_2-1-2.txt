1	Um so yeah I think that the rich should be taxed more um than well you know just on average. What do you think about that?
0	Yeah I be I believe that as well at least until we get out of the debt that we're in.
1	Yeah no I agree I think that um, well though either way you look at it even though they're being like being taxed a higher percentage an actual dollar amount you know they're still having a lot more money than the other people um and you know I mean ultimately I think that's the best way to go about it and yeah you said and like you said until we get out of the current financial crisis.
0	And until we get out of the debt. I feel like it would be best because that way we can help out help out our country just by taxing a little bit more and taxing the poor a little bit less.
1	Yeah I know I mean and with the rich you know you're taxing them and they buy one less car you know but with the poor it could be someone who you know like a meal or a house or something. Yeah I agree with it.
0	Their house or something, yeah.
0	And yeah I mean that way we can make the middle class a little bit bigger, rather than having it shrink.
1	Exactly yeah the middle class should be the largest it's shrinking I believe but yeah it should be growing.
0	Exactly I feel I feel like that as well so how would we, argue this?
1	Um I mean I would say that, increasing the taxes on the poor at the moment um until we've brought a lot of people out of poverty um can just lead to more poverty it can cause people to lose their homes lose their or not be able to provide for their families and um you know uh taxing the rich, it is taxing um a larger percentage but at the same time they're still going to have more money and they're still going to be making more money than the the poor um, and yeah I larger yeah
0	Uh huh
0	So I feel like if we were presenting this as an argument we should like list the benefits taxing the the rich. We should also address we should also address like what they're going to say like how it would be bad to tax the rich but I feel like we should like just we should find a way to like disprove what they're saying because, I um that that would just make our argument you know like much more qualified just by saying like oh um yeah it may be unfair and not very democratic to tax the rich more than other people everyone should be treated equal but in a time of need where we need our our citizens to support us
1	Yeah no I agree.
1	Yeah absolutely we need assistance and we're in such debt as it is I mean trillions of dollars that's a lot $ of money um and yeah taking it from the rich it is probably the best solution to that I mean just if we if we say that you know um, the rich will still be rich and at the same time um, just they'll um this also you know, it's not going to hinder them you know uh if there's uh people in the lower classes who are trying to move up you know it allows for more economic uh growth in the in those areas you know while you may have you may be able to pay taxes or less taxes when you're poor if you advance up and you make money you know it'll allow people to make money if they like have the will and stuff.
0	Yeah I think right now the the cap like the like the lowest of the the least amount of income you have to make to pay the higher percentage is 250K, right?
1	Yeah I believe it's something I think so, yeah.
0	I think it's like that. So do you think that should stay where it is or should that increase?
1	Um I would say that it should probably stay where it is. Um, yeah I mean I think at that point um you know one of the people one of the biggest arguments for people like um in the the uh like the difference between like 100,000 and like 200,000 would be like alright would be like college tuition and you know that's probably like you know too much to take financial aid but you know I think at that 250,000 you're still able to pay for things like that things that may not be like necessary like food but at the same time may be reasonable the expenses that you want to pay for.
0	You think it should stay there okay.
0	Yeah. Uh honestly I feel like it should maybe increase by another 100K just because if you if you're at that 250K and you're putting kids through college and stuff like you were saying you might have to live a different lifestyle than you were accustomed to and you don't and as a government I don't think you would want to put that upon your citizens so that's why I think it should go up but
1	That's uh I mean yeah that's definitely something that you'd say and that's also um kind of like a, like a um a bargain you know we're raising taxpayers yeah that's good to definitely a good argument claim especially on somebody that like
0	Yeah. I get you I get what you're trying to say yeah.
0	Like just compromise a little bit and that that'll probably help further the cost.
1	Yeah right
1	. No yeah I agree um, but yeah other than that I mean, yeah really if you believe like they should be taxed more that's
0	Yeah I agree.
1	Oh um so, uh I don't know I mean other than those points you think there's any other points that we could
0	Anything else let's see, so they should let let's list the points real quick. They should be taxed more that's a given.
1	Yeah definitely. Um you know uh raising the uh limit
0	And just until until we get out of out of our debt then we go back to taxing everyone the same. We need to increase the middle class increase the size of the middle class
1	Yeah you're right
1	Yeah and lowering the tax for middle class the poorer class can do that um and
0	Things like yeah. The those are so those are the things we need to do um
1	Um it'll allow for um financial stability of the lower classes and it'll also allow for um possible moving up in class yeah and
0	Do you wait do you know how the breakdown goes of the percent the percentages that are being taxed?
1	I honestly don't. No yeah um, yeah I'm not too sure but
0	From what I think I think from what I understood it's like once you're at the 250K plus it's a certain percentage and then if you blow that it's another percentage
1	Oh yeah no it is I I'm not sure what the actual percentage is yeah
0	But I feel like I feel like they should break it down more like to be to like more like 250K to 500K or something like that or like 1 million to something else. It should be broken down into higher percentages or lower percentages. I feel like that would be that would also be beneficial because you have like the 1% and if they're being taxed the same as the people making 250K
1	You think that
1	No yeah I get what you're saying so the super rich should be taxed even like even more than the regular rich as far as percentage wise
0	I I $ I can guarantee a lot of people won't like that idea at first but I feel like if we do this for a good amount of time we can it would help getting rid of the debt that we're currently in.
1	Another point we could argue is that a lot of um, the money that is being spent by the rich um is going into uh political contributions and um lowering that money kind of um increases the uh political equality among people who don't necessarily live by it
0	That that's a good point I didn't think of that but that's pretty good actually yeah. We could bring we could bring that up as well if we were to argue this.
1	Yeah definitely um, yeah
0	Well what else do we have? So we need to we went over it we got to um tax the rich even more. Uh increase the middle class. Um, I what we just said which was uh break it down break down the percentages of being taxed even more. Increase the 250K. What would you are you would you be able to agree with that?
1	I would yeah I would agree.
0	Okay to increase the 250K by whatever number and then uh what was your 5th one?
1	Um just that it would allow for um I mean a fifth point in change time so they have things so you know just um like for the to benefit for the those
0	Yeah. And then we would uh list their points and find ways why that wouldn't work out.
1	Yeah um I mean just if you have like a flat tax or the opposite such as like uh the poor being taxed more in higher percentages that could just that's just going to lead to the rich being more rich than they are and um it's going to keep more people in, exactly.
0	And the poor and the poor getting poorer and the middle class shrinking, which would not prove for a stable economy.
1	Yeah and definitely no.
0	Yeah it makes sense.
1	Yeah um...mm I don't know xxx
0	I'm not sure either the...let's see
0	Why do you think that the tax rich should be taxed more?
0	For the greater good.
