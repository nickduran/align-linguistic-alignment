0	no $
1	no exactly.
0	do we have to debate or? because I
0	so I think that's saying and because like an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth so um if someone killed a person then he should be like receive consequences.
1	yeah exactly. The thing is like some people I know if a person's killed a person for some you should look up like background of the person uh had like you know let's just say, you have a husband right? Uh he has a daughter, a wife, you know two kids whatever. Let's just say another man comes along you know and he takes the life of his son right? And then the guy finds the husband finds out who that person was right? And he goes and hunts down that person and kills him. Okay he should go to jail he should go to jail but, he did take revenge for it that's wrong that is wrong but at the same time like you got to understand why he went after that person, right? So like if it was that situation I don't think that person does deserve to die. He does does deserve maybe maybe a few you know years in jail you know but then
0	so basically it's like depending on the situation.
1	exactly yeah. so exactly if you were to go to jail you know given a few years in prison or something like that, what I mean is I don't think you'll ever do it again you know. But it is wrong for him to do that but then you can understand a person. I mean if I was in the sitaution, I'd be hurt. You know.
0	uh huh
0	uh huh
0	I $ I don't know what to say well um I think I don't know I agree $
1	if you
1	you know let's just say my mom was killed. I think I would actually want to go after that person too.
1	at the same time I don't think I would kill but maybe you know I'd be pissed you know.
0	oh well
1	do we keep going?
1	6 more minutes
0	can't think of anything.
1	I got nothing
0	no $
1	we'll see
1	does it depend on the death penalty for you or no?
0	$ really
0	They have psychology like criminal actions yeah it's an upper division class.
1	okay no
1	I think we should enforce it here. The death penalty.
0	yeah $
1	no seriously. I'd have used it. I would
0	. I think they have that course my roommate's taking it so
1	whoa I never knew that
1	what would you learn about that the psychology behind criminality?
0	it's $
1	oh really? I'll definitely check it out.
1	it's up to you
0	okay so I think it should should not be legalized because um what I wrote $ for okay because um it's uh it should be only legalized for medical um medical services if it's good for uh patients and stuff but um if it's not then it will cause like chaotic situations in society so
1	I believe that marijuana should be legal and here's why check this out. If we made marijuana legal we could california's in debt obviously the whole world's in debt. We could make it legal and tax it and people buy it and there should be like restrictions prohibition things like drinking and driving obviously you can't do that so smoking and driving you shouldn't do that either. There should be like rules you know and within you know within there should be groundwork to do things like weed. You know what I'm trying to say? But I think it should be legal also because the thing is weed is a drug it is right? But the thing is it's not the worst of worst. It is herbal and all natural. And the thing is they did uh some those few studies that have done it and people's like researchers say that it does mess with you know it messes with your head. What was it what was that thing? It they said it kills brain cells. Well you know how they prove that? You know what they did to prove that? They took a bunch of monkeys they put them in like a room and they gassed them with marijuana smoke. Of course that's there's that much going on, right?
0	but if you use it for a long time then
1	of course they don't mess with their brains. Yeah if you use it for a long time also. The thing is if you use it constantly like every day drinking too. If you're drinking every day I'm sure it's going to harm you but if you drink like once or twice a month it's bad for you but it's not going to harm you you know. In the long run it might but it's not going to harm you that much you know? I think that weed is also marijuana. Well, actually it if you do it like once or twice a month it actually stimulates your brain it gets it working actually. But if you're doing it too much it messus up in your brain. Like dopamine.
0	do you do it? $
0	do you do it?
1	no I don't do it.
0	$ really?
1	no I don't
0	oh well $. So um basically I think uh it should not be legalized anyway so
1	yeah I believe it should.
0	because one of my friends he did it but then uh he just uh dropped out of college afterwards. The dropout rate is higher if you use
1	But then with parmeters you know.
1	Yeah if you're doing it same with you know drinking's legal. If you're drinking too much the dropout rate's even higher too. So important to control that.
0	that's why you shouldn't drink in college until you're 21 years old
1	yeah that's true though
1	yeah I think you're right though I agree you should be 21. Not 18. I think that we're too young at that age to because our brains are still developing or I mean by 21 our brains are still developing. The things is at least you know it's more more developed than age 18 because 18-year olds like when you're a teenager like 14, 15, 16 you're pretty stupid I'm not going to lie. When you become 18, 19, 20, 21 you start maturing up you know? So yeah you're right. There I
0	anything to say $?
0	you start like taking responsibilities and stuff
1	yeah. you you're going to college too I mean like you have so much freedom you could do stuff you know. Back home you have your parents watching you don't do this don't do this and like college shows truly really who's the adult. If you like drop out you know they might have some stress reasons why they did but it shows who the real true adult is you know?
