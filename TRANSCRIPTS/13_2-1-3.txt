0	um I said that it um I said that it had there were situations where I believe it's appropriate but um when its when it when it should be uh should be used it should be used sparingly and like very i guess uh scrutinously reviewed as to like whether or not like it's appropriate for like a specific case like I don't think it's necessarilly a I don't think it's necessarily a penalty where oh crimes of a specific like oh its like a specific crime should automatically get the death penalty but it's more of like a a per case scenario
1	yeah that's that's how I feel Like let's say like oh if you rob a bank or if you kill someone I mean if it's just the one person but I mean if you're a serial killer and a rapist then or a pedophile that's I then I feel that's appropriate
0	yeah that that's that's basically that's basically what I was thinking right now is putting it down um I was I I thought of like um particullar situations like like I know I mean I'm sure it's happened before the reason I like thought about it so much is cause I know I'm sure there have been reasons before or there have been cases before where people have been wrongly death penalized like it has to have happened at some point and that's why like I think that like it should always be reviewed carefully and so that was like that was like the only reason I like was holding back a little
1	yeah well I think that could happen with any other sentence your not guna place someone that's innocent for like twenty years in jail in prison then I feel like they should let's say like if they're serial killers and rapists and all that like obviously if they're in prison like they're still gonna have contact with other human beings and like like
0	and sometimes they may even get out like after some point of time
1	like you know how some are like oh on probabtion or like how they're um like if you're well behaved they let you out early or something like that like I don't know like how do you know they're not gonna do it again right?
0	that's that's exactly what I feel and I mean like I just yeah I just feel like it's sometimes it's just really I don't know It's really like nerve racking I guess in a way that like or like serial killers or like serial rapistsor like people like that can like still have the opportunity to just integrate themselves back into society after they like ocmmit crimes like that
1	yeah and then well when you think about that and then if they're in prison like all the money spent on them I don't think it's worth it how they even sometimes provide education for them [...]
0	mm oh yeah
0	that's true and that and that like that like that money and prison space could go to like somebody that could actually rehabilitate like someone like white like I don't know white collar crime like something they can like rehabilitate and like actually like become like a functional part of society
1	like other
1	yeah they could contribute themselves to society not like someone that's gonna cause I mean I'm pretty sure if someone like killed many times it's not like I don't or like twenty years later like oh I'm high
0	yeah exactly like there's there's always like there's like a mental thing going on that's how I feel and yeah that's that's basically how I drew the line it was it was in my mind it was kind of like a serial thing
1	yeah it wasn't just like a one time thing or like
0	cause I mean like they they do have like I mean I'm a I'm not particularly knowledgable about when they currently when they do that penalty and when they don't I just know that we're there are like I don't there are crimes where I'm I'm I think they do do death penalty which I'm which probably aren't strict like there it's too I think they have a distance now wherethey use death death penalty where they probably shouldn't and like I think that in those cases it should be like pulled back a little and like not be used so like across the board
1	yeah so you think it's just like a mixture in cases right?
0	and yeah anything else? um hmm nothing comes to mind I can't think of anything else
1	than money and then it'd be like safety
0	money safety um I guess like victim comfort like I mean a lot of a lot of like family members of victims I guess I mean like you always you always see in like in the movies or whenever like that's obviously exagerated but family members obviously feel a lot of grief like if they have like a serial killer that's like victimizing their family members that isn't they don't feel like it was properly dealt with
1	they or they didn't deserve what they should've
0	yeah and
0	yeah it's hard to explain um let's see so I guess a lot of a lot of people i guess te main argument is that people think that you should never
1	take someone else's life
0	yeah you should never take a lifeand I don't really I guess I guess there's like a forgiveness argument in there that people are trying to but that people are trying to evoke that like it can anything can always be forgiven and I I I don't agree with that
1	it's just that like how do you know they're not gonna do it again
0	exactly like there's so much uncertainty
1	where you
1	yeah or even if they do like what if they um influence others to do it?
0	Oh yea that's true and you never know who that person is in contact with like you said like you know like I'm sure even even like serial killers who are who are doing life in prison get like visitor rights and like you don't know like who
1	send letters or emails
0	and you don't know who else and plus like I feel like if you don't do that like if there was a strict death penalty on like certain crimes like serial killing or like multiple murders that would deter people like [...] people but I feel like now if a lot of people I think are prob the problem is a lot of people might think that they can not get away with it but like not get off with terrible like they they to them like in their minds they think it's like the risk of like killing or like committing something like that is worth it because they they know that they won't get the death penalty or like they don't think it'll be a huge crime
1	I think that
1	they don't they will be charged with like a long time
0	yea and I feel like that would be if they did envoke to death if like they did envoke like uh like a a more specific death penalty on like exclussively serial killing somethings like that that would look much that would probably that might have been detered to the point where it would almost never happen and
