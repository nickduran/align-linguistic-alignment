1	that's true um i think i think well i don't know for me i don't think it should it shouldn't be um just because it is it's i feel like it's going to be abused...
0	Well, (was it in/it was in) Colorado it was.
1	Colorado I think was the one of the ones that got it legalized. I don't know much about i though.
0	Me neither, but I'm like if they let Colorado have it I'm pretty sure that some day it's going to happen to us.
1	Just because I'm thinking right now about California is it's just a huge state. It's very concentrated (on) people compared to like those- the states that had it passed those are reasonably smaller states compared to our state and I think the fact that if we start legalizing it I feel like you're going to start see people just smoking it (everywhere) and kids are just going to start using it more.
0	Second hand smoke.
1	I mean they are just going to get interested I think in my opinion. And I know what it does to people.
0	This is going to bring more laws.
1	There will be () are going to have a hard time making rationel choices because it'll be out there in the public. It won't be more like- more of a I shouldn't () I got to stay hidding in my little ().
0	I got to fight, feel like I could just do it right here and over there.
1	I could be like walk () on a park and do it without worrying about the police because I have my green card on me or something. That's my reason why. I know taxes it would help us out. It would definitely bring in more revenue for the state.
0	Yeah because a lot of people would compare it to like alcohol that they should like set an age for it.
1	I know one thing it'll stop - I guess that's good for (your side) that it would stop drug dealing and kind of prevent that from happening and yeah less crimes because less () really, (gang) will stop happening because they are not competing with real medical shops. Just for me I don't think it should be just because I think enough people are doing it already and I think that there are enough people that wil abuse it to the fact that it will be aboused already if it's legalized. I feel like it'll just be abused by more people this time.
0	It will be more open to everyone.
1	But I feel like it's already prescription.
0	Anyone can just go op to a random store and just-
1	Yeah right now and everyone, or as long as you have a green card right, you can just go to the store and purchase it. That's why I don't really get why, what would legalizing it do. Would it allow, what would happen then because right now I feel like it's somewhat legal already, because you can purchase it here in the states
0	There are like local stores here and there.
1	Yeah, I actually don't know too much information about legalizing it I just feel like legalizing it would just make more people use it. () reasons.
0	Yeah, it goes both ways. It depends on the person if they really need it, or will they just be using it, how you're saying it. I guess I'm on both sides then.
1	I see your side too, I see how-
0	You got to choose () for drinking like you get to choose if you want to drink or not. Is it for you or is it not for you.
1	As long as people-
1	It's your choice.
0	It's your choice.
0	() (really bigger prison)
1	What else, I just feel like California is too big of a state right now, they'll try to keep that down under control. To me it feels like California is a big marihuana (paradise) in my opinion that's probably ().
0	They are trying to be like the role model but deep down (they are just in the dark side).
1	Because I mean I feel like we have a lot of low income areas around here compared to other states, and I feel like the low income areas will definitely start taking advantage of that type (of thing), and I don't know I don't think it'll help out the, I don't know. It won't help out the economy as much. Of course as I said earlier it will be well (taxed), but I feel like they'll be taxing the wrong people.
0	And there won't be like a big difference of change in it.
1	It won't be a huge- yeah it won't really help out but I don't know the rule, I just wish I knew the rules of legalizing marihuana maybe I'd be able to talk more about it.
0	They got to do their research on it if they really want it or not.
1	I just think right know that California has other issues to worry about other than marihuana ().
0	That's one of the reasons why I havn't been positive because they are trying to focus on other problems they have.
1	Yeah, there are other issues that California is going through I think is more () than marihuana. I know there's a prop [proposition?] earlier for it but I don't think i passed. I wish I can remember the prop but I don't remember which proposition it was. I mean it's funny, because all my friends- or not all of my friends, but some of my friends are like oh it should pass and stuff like honestly they do for their own like it's what benefits them but I don't think they are thinking about the state, or at least the whole state at least and how it'll affect them and how tax ().
0	I think if it was passed for legalizing it would change as to how California looked.
1	It will because after you heard that those states passed it, you kind of look at them a little differently know.
0	Yeah I do. I was like Colorado are you serious, like okay then that means like any state can do it.
1	Yeah and like everyone's is just going to move in there now and start doing it.
0	Right just for that. That's all they are going to be known for.
1	Like let's go over to this state and we can go hang out and do stuff you know. I don't know it's nice to keep that stuff at home I think, keeping it low profile even if it's illegal keeping it low profile will definitely keep (nonsense) crime outside in the public low because maybe people will make- people will just stay at home and not try to be in (gangs) or trouble or anything because of course-
0	I'll prevent from lots of big things from happen.
1	() from happening too. That's why I think so, but I mean I don't know it just depends. I would need to look into it. Like I said both of us really don't know anytning about it.
0	Yeah, it's just what we hear and what we see.
