0	okay um so health care should not be universal because we uh should not have to pay for um other people getting sick especially if you are a healthy person and so if you are constantly getting sick you should um be um pay for it and also paying for it will eventually make you um not get sick so you will be aware of like oh um i will try not to get sick because i do not have health care so yeah
1	well, i just feel that we should have universal health care because countries like canada and switzerland and sweden have universal health care that provides for everybody so i think about those people with lower income who cannot afford medical treatment and so they need to seek attention and also like the elderly who cannot work anymore maybe their retirement funds plan is not enough to sustain them to get health care so i think health care for everyone would be great probably like a basic plan or something um i do not know the logistics of it but i know with the obama care he was trying to make health care affordable to a lot of americans because there is a high percentage of people who do not have health care right now and so having universal health care would not have to worry about like having to either save for it or pay out of their own pocket when they have other things to do so that is why i was pro universal health care

0	okay so you then you feel that we should pay for um
1	health care
0	health care yeah
1	well i think that obviously it would come out of our taxes so everybody's taxes would be able to i guess provide that plan so that we can have universal health care for everybody
0	um so then what happens to the uh the lawsuits that are going on with the doctors that are um what is it called that are like doing multiple malfunctions um malpractices are at a higher rate now at this time so what happens when um they um what is it called it is universal you will not be able to receive what is it called the like the money that was that needs when you fix them up malpractice or something
1	hm hm i think universal health care and the way that people talk about it and the way that i understand it is yeah having those doctors um but also not every doctor does malpractice and also like malpractice is not something that has a huge percentage is going on in america and also there is always going be like people making mistakes expesically doctors whether it is the treatment or the diagnosis it is i am not just saying that because of universal health care the percentage will go higher um i don't think that will happen personally but it is just that um people who are educated and getting their MD in medicine and stuff should be capable of practicing
0	hm hm
0	um so you mean to say that um well yeah that malpractices are like you said at a higher rate but um i mean there are few that happen and um malpractices should be like if it were if it were if health care would be universal then that would mean lets say something happens to someone you know and then um i believe that they like should be compensated with what the malpractices you know i know like not many happen like you say there is not a huge amount but there are malpractices out there
1	i think that what whether there is universal health care or not universal health care there will always be malpractices that doctors had before
0	but then if being free wouldn't where where would you get the money or where you would how would you like benefit from a malpractice if its free like then if its free then universal health care is free then no one would be able to help your malpractice you know and if there is um uh universal health care and everybody pays it you would not be able to know you like be um helped out or aided because of your malpractice so you know it is like um um
1	well i mean universal health care free for everybody i do not think necessarily free becuase i think that surgery and other types of treatments will probably be come with a price because everything cannot be completely free so i think that what you are trying to um my understanding of what you are trying to say talking about malpractices and then how if its free you know doctors can not just do the current job they are supposed to but they are still liable and accounte for doctors have taken an oath you know that they will do their best to try to help people regardless of the situation and malpractices are just a mistake that they make and obviously the hospital would have to compensate or the govenment would have to compensate for that so why necessarily are you against universal health care

0	i mean i feel that no one or people should not have to pay for others you know i mean if you are a healthy person and if you take good care of yourself um why should we have to pay for others or you know like why you know should we have to pay for someone that um i do not know does not take care of their health either drinks a lot or be like um i do not know basically does not take care of themselves
1	um i do not think that it is much that people that health people are paying and that other people are not taking care of themeslves it is also coming down to like people can not afford health care and i understand your point like why should i when i am perfectly healthy have to pay for someone else to get health care that i am not using but i think that at some point in your life or anybodys like they have a time to go seek out medical assistance for one thing or another whether it is small or big
