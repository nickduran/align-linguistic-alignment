1	that it should be
1	okay why did you say that?
0	Because the reason why the politicans don't tax the richer Americans is because they believe that if they don't tax them they're going to have more workers work for them but yet that's making the social factor- still making them on top and not making quality for the working class.
1	Okay, I though it was more of a, something that these people that are rich - maybe not all of them, some of them have inherited - but a lot of them they work from the bottom up. I have people in my family that I know they came from the poor side. My uncles parents pretty much worked in the field since they were little and then now he's making over three hundred thousand dollars and I mean, so I feel that I know he's worked hard and I know a few other people that are the same way, the same situation, and it's like why should they for having worked hard and being good at what they do, they shoudn't be taxed more (and) something they earned and worked hard for. Because I know me if I worked hard to become a doctor which I want to, and if i make over to hundred-three hundred thousand dollars a year it's like I worked so hard for this money now I'm getting taxed so much money, it's just like-
0	So your stance is that it shouldn't be taxed.
0	Or that they should?
1	They shouldn't be taxed as much. Because I feel it's like they earned their money, so it's like taking away.
0	That's a small popularity (most of them).
1	It is.
1	But say if they open their businesses, or even small business, and they still make quite at bit and considering rich they can still hire local people to work for them and that is also helping out the lower class. And I feel everyone has an equal opportunity in the (world) kind of thing. So I feel that everyone can kind of do it. () Everyone can start at the bottom even famous people they always have stories of being nothing and all of the sudden getting lucky and meeting another singer and something and all of the sudden they take (him) in like a U2 star, from nothing in one day and another day all of the sudden they're are super famous making a whole bunch of money. Maybe that wasn't as earned but it's still- it stays in their skills to make what they earned kind of thing.
0	But a lot of the rich () aren't being taxed. The working class is taxed more, are taxed more than what the upper class- the rich. You think that's fair?
1	I haven't heard it so much but if that's the case then I dont't know.
0	That is basically like the working class and the poor people are taxed so much and the (richer) are not even taxed anything. Or their percentage is low. I don't think that's fair because they have so much money and yet they are not be taxed and people who are poor who don't have any money are being taxed so much.
1	I think also we can look at people like Bill Gates, he's a billionaire, right, like top four, I don't know. He just went down or something. But I mean he has so many foundations. He has the Gates Millenium Scholarship and it pretty much pays anyones (). And I knew of two people who got that scholarship from my high school and even if he is making so much money he's still thinking of other people so many of the rich have made foundations or the () they're pouring money, Oprah is ptting money into-
0	That's not the () the rich people, like all of them.
1	I mean I'm just high lighting (some) examples. These are the super rich that are making foundations and stuff, they are- or the awareness like campaigns and go out-
0	Well I understand people who are () rich, like super rich, but I mean yeah you donate to a organization or found a foundation your taxes are going to be lowered, but I'm talking about people who don't do any of that. And they still don't get taxed because the Republicans think they are going to give back to (the) community by hiring local people but I still don't think that's fair that they don't get taxed anything, or hardly any and yet the working class (they/we) get taxed till the very end. Till the last cent.
1	But then you can also think of in the terms of rich people have to pay for everything they have. I don't want to (do) the healthcare because that wasn't the question but I mean healthcare, the rich have to pay all that on their own. If they go to the hospital, say it's a two hundred thousand dollar hospital bill for, I don't know, maybe something super small like an appendix, I don't know, something crazy, and then all of the sudden they ended up with (this), but someone of lower class have these benefits of healthcare or that they only have to pay a minimun amount, sometimes they're free through the government, so I feel it's like checks and balances kind of thing, so even they aren't taxed so much, you still get some benefits being super low, in poverty. And I feel like (you) balance that with giving money and also you start paying a whole bunch, you don't get away with things. And on the point of earning the money, if you worked hard for it. I know if I worked super hard I would want my entire thing and I used to get taxed- (). I don't know I feel like they should be proportioned, if these guys get taxed this much, they should get taxed the same. But still I don't think it should be more for the rich or more for the poor kind of thing. This one was easier to talk about.
0	I'm trying to incorporate a movie.
1	Another one.
0	() Obama fighting for this and () presidential election.
1	For this?
1	I mean yeah, that is always a big debate. Republicans are going to tax all this and the other way around. But I guess Obama want to take (). I don't know what else to add to that.
0	() because the Republicans (). They were debating that topic.
1	No, I didn't watch it that day. (). Which day was the topic on?
0	() topic and- () it was just (a bit) complex (funny) issue).
