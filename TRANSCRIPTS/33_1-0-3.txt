1	um honestly abortion okay that I believe no life should be taken away that's just totally it should not be legal honestly but the thing is what if a woman is raped and she has a child then what? You know what I'm trying to say?
0	because I heard that there's like services you can give your um child away
1	yeah that's true though too but then like I understand that that's so true but then what if what if like she like a woman is raped you know and she has a kid now. Okay it takes 9 months to you know you know I know she can give it away but take those 9 months still put a toll on that girl you know what I'm trying to say? What if she's a college student a high school student I mean it does take a toll on you you know and if there's so many people saying oh you know you're a whore you're a slut you know there's always that but she was raped you know because people judge. When you look look at a young girl holding a baby you know it so what do you do honestly abortion? I don't know it should be it should not be legal but then it should be legal for those that had a kid for different circumstances you know what I'm trying to say if a woman if a case is born alright and she it's proven that the man raped her or something like that then maybe yes for her abortion should be legal because honestly and even on her part right it is wrong to take the child's life away. If I were a woman and I were raped I honestly I would be torn. I I'm not going to lie I'd be torn. But the thing is now I have a child so I wouldn't know what to do to be honest because I I don't want to take the life away because all life is sacred everything deserves to live. Even my religion my religion is
0	if you don't want to
0	uh huh
0	but if you think in point of view of the baby then it's not a fair thing to do.
1	that's true though. It's so true.
0	if you want to like you're having a baby and the baby's you're killing the baby. That's murder.
1	that's true that is. But then then again the debate comes up okay so the thing is a child if it's a fetus it does not feel pain and is is it really a child? But true I believe you it honestly it is killing I believe it's murder too I think you're taking a life away because the life was you know? In my religion uh when you become uh in our religion you become uh it's called you take holy water and you become it's like being baptized but then in our case it's called xx xxx right and the thing is you take an oath to never eat meat uh to not drink and the thing is you don't eat meat because like it's life you know so you can say that the animals are already dead right? But the thing is let's just say everyone in the world stopped eating meat right. Would farmers and people kill animals to make meat? No right? So it kind of I don't know where I'm going with this but like it's life yes. Life shouldn't be taken away so back to what I was saying if I was I wouldn't know what to do. Abortion is such a like difficult topic I don't know I wouldn't know what to do honestly. It should you should not take life away but then there's some people that they get wronged you know what I'm trying to say? So then for them I guess it should be legal but at the same time they should really think about what they're doing if they're going to abort the child I mean think about it
0	uh huh because there are like services to stop this problem out so that's funny too
1	yeah that's true also there are services that will help you out but then again those 9 months you're still carrying your you know what I'm trying to say? The thing to and you you being a woman you would understand that come on 9 months? 9 months you're going to have a child in there you know. So yeah there is a lot to do. You have to eat right you know? It's just difficult. How much time left?
0	uh huh a lot to do so
0	"yeah. Want to change a topic or ""$"" something?"
1	oh that's good better than the last one.
1	no I think 21's a good age.
0	I put yes or um lower the age. yeah. yeah because in like internationally in Asian and other places they're all like 18 and they're all fine. So
1	you really? It should be lowered? Why do you believe that?
1	that's true but the thing is I think they know how to drink responsibly because
0	"oh no ""$"" no there's no difference."
0	Yeah they're all teenagers what's the difference?
1	but I feel like it's in an Asian culture right? like
0	yeah yeah Asian culture.
1	the thing is Asian culture has more um like like respect you know what I'm trying to say?
0	because there are like examples that in other countries they're lowered to 18 and they're fine so that's why I think it should be.
1	yeah that's true though that's a good point. But I really think okay it should be left alone the 21 age is fine because the thing is at that age you're still like pretty young
0	because like I think the age is like physically and if you're not mature then mentally even if you're 21 you're still unable to take responsibilities so
1	that's true also but yeah I feel that it should be 21 the same because you if you want you know I feel 21's a good age. I think 18 year olds are still not maybe like you some people are responsible like some 18 19 year olds they do drink they they but they're are some even that's true in adults too but the thing is that I feel that 21's a good age let's just keep it that way you know? So but you make a good point there too. How much time left?
0	3 more.
1	xxx xxx
0	um I put yes because they have more income so it's like income tax still.
1	yeah I believe so too but then it should be like on a ratio meter you know what I'm trying to say? A ratio court yeah I think they should be too because they go up higher
0	uh huh
0	because it depends on how much you earn so it'll like balance out the poor and riches.
1	yeah it does balance yeah it balances society that's true I agree. How much time like 2 minutes? At least you know.
0	uh huh
0	$ that's the last view
0	oh for drinking um you know there are like college parties there are a lot of people there 18 they still drink it and
1	yeah that's true. That's what you believe?
0	yeah. So I think it doesn't make any difference if you're drinking
