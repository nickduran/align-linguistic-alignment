1	So um, I I'm against abortion.
1	And you are too right?
0	Yeah yeah I'm uh I'm against it dude yeah.
1	I mean the way I feel is that um I mean, even if you know under if this baby was you know conceived um con like without consent, yeah, yeah unconsensually and, even if that is the case um, I mean that baby that life inside you still has a right to live and if you really don't want it I mean you can still have it and put it up for adoption and don't even have to to kill it you know? I mean it is unfortunate I mean it being it might be unfortunate, but still I mean, you should still be responsible for your for this life that you're carrying.
0	Right under bad circumstances unconsensually yeah, yeah
0	Yeah but yeah...that's true man.
0	That's true man because that's stuff like that happens you know and like that's a part of you why would you want to like, you know kill a part of you you know? Don't you like feel like that's a part of you that you're killing? Wouldn't you like feel guilty about that like you know? So don't do you feel pretty strongly about this?
1	I feel pretty strongly.
0	Yeah me too man. Yeah...yeah.
1	And it's like um, uh for uh as a personal thing uh, when I what my parents told me that they when I was um conceived that it was um it was around the time um, 19 1994 19 1994 where they I mean there was uh there was a man that was saying the world was going to end and they were young and they they were under the influence and that's why they did it and, it could've been a possibility that I could have been aborted but, you know. I mean I definitely feel like there's alot of alot of babies that could be aborted that actually if they were born they could have a benefit to society and it's alot of life that's being wasted.
0	Yeah that is true man I mean...I feel like I'm kind of like in your sh like like I feel the same way about you you too like like how I'm in this no I I feel like I'm in the same position as you cause for but except for like, it's like 1 step further up to my where my father is because like, uh my father was almost aborted too by his om because his mom like took alot of drugs to try to abort him $ and I was like it's it was kinda it's terrible because uh she was forced to get married and like so she didn't want my dad so she tried to take all these drugs and all just, to abort my dad and I also wondered if my dad wasn't born I wouldn't be born right now too so I feel like I do feel strongly against that dude hh yeah man.
1	Yeah I agree. I mean it's just like uh, I I believe even even if even if like there's an argument that like, the circumstances of a baby that that, that uh someone would want to abort if their lives would probably be would probably be just to have alot of struggle and and things like that but I mean I I even if that is the case even if that is true and it's not true all the time there's alot of cases where that that wouldn't be true but I I believe that that life should have a chance at least a chance to to a chance at life like the way the living any life form could have a chance at life. You know?
0	Yeah I totally agree with that man.
1	Um, yeah I mean, it's definitely it's definitely something I see you know it's it's being taken alot more lightly I mean alot people are even saying that like it when it's when it's in the in the womb that it doesn't it's actually not alive, I mean it has a beating heart it has organs it has xxx it is a life form in there it's a life in there...and it's horrible I mean you see the images of abortions
0	Yeah, true man.
0	Oh gosh I can't even look man I I don't want to look like I hear about it but I just can't bring myself to look at that it's just like, that's a human being right there man like I feel like I don't know.
1	Yeah I mean, that's definitely I mean that's that's a serious that's a for me it's a really serious, a really serious problem. I mean that's like, that's a that's a human that's a human life it's not a, it's not a it's not a small thing.
0	Yeah...they're all like, like imagine if like you know that was you or that was you know, if that was us $ you know like well, that was like wouldn't you want to have a chance as well? Like and for I mean for arguing towards people that would be for abortion you know. That would be you know pro-abortion like pro-choice? Hh...
1	I mean yeah I mean, and even I mean if there was this chance you know that their parents didn't want them that they wouldn't be able to to be alive either. But um...but yeah I mean it's like um, in alot of cases where uh I mean teenagers you know going out having unpro not having sex I mean they need to understand that the accept the consequences I think. You can't just, you can't just like go to a clinic I mean and and just, take take your your baby out just because you know I mean it if if that's a mistake that you made you need to take responsibility.
0	Uh yeah that's uh I see what you mean man with today's culture it's just like we can fix every problem like yeah I don't want to have this problem so I'm just going to, kill this off and not have to worry about it. Hh it's just horrible.
1	Yeah. It's like now it's like now you don't even need your parent parental consent when you're like, 14 15. Yeah it's like, I mean it's like do you you need permission to get a piercing or a tattoo but you don't need to, you know abort a baby. I mean even if it's their choice even I even if with that choice I mean even if they do have that choice I think it should be, um. There should be more rules to it. I mean you should should have a parental consent to do that. Even if I mean even though I don't agree with you but still, now it's just anyone can get an abortion there isn't, it's just like it's like anything you know.
0	Dang. Crazy.
0	Dang that's bad. Yeah.
0	Right. Like something you can just, yeah buy or something you could just use or it's not ss, they act like it's a life isn't special like a life is just another life right? Like it's just something, um...
1	Yeah. It's definitely, something very serious that is not taken, as serious as it as it should. I think it should. Um, but yeah I could see how um, you know they might bring up facts that you know the world is getting overpopulated but you know, it's like um... I I still I mean I still think that the the reasons against it are much greater than the reasons for it. Even even if there are some um, some good reasons for it I still think that the reasons against it are far outweigh, the reasons for it.
0	And some reasons for it would just be, for what convenience? What the hell $, like
1	Yeah I know.
1	Yeah. It's uh, I mean it's uh, it's uh very selfish I I think. Very selfish because like you're you're not thinking about anyone else you're just thinking about how you'd make your life easier... I mean I I do see how it can be a problem in you know countries like third world countries like, I mean. Let's start I mean let's start here in our country, where it is legal but there are I mean we're privileged to to be able to give birth to these babies and have a place for them you know even if their parents don't want to keep them.
0	Yeah I mean I feel like yeah knowing that we're we have the you know the privilege to abort that we should be even more cautious like you know of like you know having sex and stuff like that or like, just being more preventative or you know and maybe just even avoiding sex all in general $ so you don't. I don't know well, I don't know.
