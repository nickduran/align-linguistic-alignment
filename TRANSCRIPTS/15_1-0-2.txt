1	okay so what did you say about abortion?
0	I say abortion should be able to in all circumstances.
1	yeah that is what I pretty much said. I know like it like people are like oh it is probably it is against my religion but
0	well that is their choice then you know. #
1	yeah I know it is like it is completely against my religion but I keep telling them like if like there is some people that can not be parents like to be honest. There is some people that can not be parents. # Like have you like seen the show like teen moms? I mean they are like they are like sixteen and they are like pregnant.
0	no I have not.
0	dude I had people in my high school that were pregnant. like no not even pregnant they had kids come to class. but you know it is my high school. like I had like I had like chicks in my high school that were like I am going to be the coolest mom! pregnant and all.
1	you serious?
1	wow okay yeah.
1	ah see you see that is like you have to like know about them.
0	hey dude as long as it works out for your life. I hope you are going to be able to feed that baby but
1	I guess yeah I guess but see that is why I guess like it is okay. but I think that to an extent like when is the limit to like to like get an abortion. that is my thing.
0	I guess as far as many times or as far as trimesters?
1	yeah that is what it comes like you do not want to like abort a whole baby like. that because you see that were you here when they had like the abortion signs outside? like they were like the signs and then they had the
0	you know those images were inaccurate right?
1	yeah those were like they were really
0	but you are a bio major you know? at two weeks fingers?
1	yeah I know because they said at six weeks they had feet yeah it had fingers I was like that is not even physically possible. because you do not even know you are pregnant like until like you are like three weeks and you are like uh oh something is wrong yeah so
0	granted they were sneaky about that one because they were not directly saying that abortion should be illegal should not be legal they were being sneaky about hey here is some shock imagery! what do you think?
1	they were just showing
1	yeah yeah I was like that is totally a doll's hand but okay. yeah.
0	you know I just think that is kind of insidious because you know it is the stimuli that is you know shock imagery associated with uh an abortion which is associated with women women's rights it kind of like primes you to uh with the feeling of disgust associated with women which I do not necessarily agree with.
1	yeah but I think it is like their tactic was more of like a scare tactic. like this is what it looks like. I do not know but as I said like people should not be like against it because technically if you like abort early it is not really a life yet. well that is my like opinion you know yeah.
0	oh oh oh that is right I um believe it is like in tennessee there was um some interesting legislation passed um so the day the day of conception because you know you have to have conception before you get an abortion. it can now be thirty days before you actually conceived
1	are you serious?
0	yeah because it was something about the indeterminate period of when it can be detected so now it is automatically it is thirty days prior
1	#but that is see that is that is that is unreasonable.
0	and like and like I think it is in like another state nevada or some shit like that it is um we are now determining that life starts at the point of conception which you know is about a measure of how many um you know fertalized eggs actually become a baby naturally.
1	imagine it is just pretty much one. because you just have one embryo. like pretty much any
0	or like what what is the odds of that embryo # that not even embryo that fertalized cell will even become a baby?
1	pretty it depends on when the mother is ovulate like ovulating # ovulate ovulating or is it yeah. so pretty much like you have a lot of sperms but only one egg at a time.
0	no I am saying even if it is fertalized like I do not know I did I did a little reading about it
1	What are the times of it being a baby? it is pretty pretty high. Unless she has a
0	I heard it was less than twenty percent because you know it is fertalized but within a couple days it has to it has to it has to your cell it has to attach to your uterine wall.
1	oh I think it is
1	oh you could have a miscarriage
1	yeah but see I do not understand how like how young kids are getting pregnant so easily. when like a woman is forties
0	well you got to stop teaching abstinence.
1	yeah well yeah that is the thing they should practice safe sex. like look alive and you are twelve and you are already having you are going to have a baby and something?
0	well maybe we should look at how they are being raised.
1	that is true but I do not know that is why like I am really if you should really consider your options. for me like if abortion is like the best like decision
0	I think that there should probably be some government incentive if you are say in the third trimester and
1	yeah like there has to be a time. like that is my thing.
0	I would say an incentive like I do not know look I mean if you
1	the first trimester. that is what I am thinking. like the first trimester is like reasonable. that should be if you are past your first trimester that should be your cut off for abortion and just go through with adoption or something. I do not know.
0	well I I do not know I mean I think I still think that you should have the right but I I do not know if I am I do not know about my opinion if if there should be a government incentive for example a tax break if you decide to not have an abortion and and no that actually nah that is probably (____). never mind then. for a spare moment thought.
1	well I think that like if they are after their first trimester if like the doctors catch like the mother and the baby are in danger of like dying during birth then then yeah that should be that is what I think I do not know it is a very it is a very touchy subject and like a lot of people they are like pro-life or pro-choice and like it is it is whatever like it is whatever people like it is like whatever people feel is right for like their situation I do not know I am very neutral. #
0	oh there is not question already.
0	mm but legislation-wise so no one is directly attacking abortion like anymore but what is uh what is going on is um I would say inconvenience laws for example laws that mandate hey you need to get an ultrasound and you need to sign that you have seen your baby before you get an abortion. you also have to do this like a couple times and that gets a little iffy when there is one abortion center in your entire state and you have to drive seven hundred miles to it. but uh I do not know what is your opinion on those? because that is really the modern context of abortion is inconvenience laws and also especially for uh people who are not adults yet you know have to get adult consent laws as well as questions of whether or not minors should be able to have abortions.
1	ake sure yeah
1	*yeah. I know
1	yeah you have to get the parent yeah.
1	I think I think minors should because they have their whole life ahead of them and to have a baby in the way is
0	oh definitely. I mean you know go to college and all.
1	yeah. okay look if you seriously have seen those shows like you know sixteen and pregnant or teen mom you just want to slap them in the face and be like you should go to you should focus on school like play with your like legos and not have sex like that that thing yeah no you would want to like slap them in the face
0	well what do you think about uh adult consent laws?
1	I think there should be if the like if the parents like if if they are smart enough they should they should be able to like have a say and say this is not good for you.
0	I mean what if my parents do not want me to have an abortion?
0	mm but um that is infringing on my rights to have an abortion. if my parents say if my parents if my parents are crazy religious people that are like no you may not have an abortion you will have that baby.
1	# if they want? oh okay. yea.
1	alright oh yeah okay let us say if you know yeah and so you want the abortion and then you want the abortion and your parents do not?
0	you know if I am a minor and my parents are have that opinion should I be able to have one?
0	and what happens in that scenario?
1	yeah that is a good one.
0	I mean the other big factor in these laws is well you have to inform your parents that you are getting the abortion which also by that matter means that the informing you law requires that you tell your parents that you are having sex or you got raped and you are pregnant. which I do not know especially in a lot of uh violence and aggresive you know atmospheres in homes that might be good for anyone's safety.
1	who wants to have a baby?
1	yeah so I do not I do not know that is why there should just be a law that you should have like you should have kids when you are at this age. that is why like China they have that thing where you can only have allowed one baby and you have to get consent for that.
0	but you realize what goes on with that law in china. um
1	yeah those people have
0	people have them anyways and either
1	and they are killing girls pretty much.
0	yeah either abort them immediately because it is the wrong gender or they um have the baby secretly and sell it.
1	*yeah. yeah.
1	and then raise it oh yeah I heard about that. they sell it to Americans.
0	yeah and they also buy them.
1	yeah yeah I have I have seen there is a documentary on that uh #
0	yeah I I think the legislation kind of failed with that one. #
1	I do not know. there is too many
