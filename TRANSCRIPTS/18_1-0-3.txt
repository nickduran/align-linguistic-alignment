0	okay. my dad is a doctor # so I directly see how the healthcare bill affects my family. um and it actually like you know once government gets involved with anything # it all just nothing good comes of it um I
1	can you?
0	yeah. let me let me like the DMV like if it were like privately owned you would be in and out. like the lines would not be like seventy people long. have you been to the DMV before?
1	oh yeah.
0	yeah it is ridiculous right? government anything government run it is just like it is painful to like get anything done. no one listens to you.
1	but can you can you explain your perspective and how you see the hospital situation.
0	yeah my my dad owns his own private corporation and he is a surgeon and um with the medicare bill um patients or the they do not pay the doctors as much as they were before um so we get like a what
1	so a universal healthcare for like the whole nation would decrease pay for like the doctors? okay.
0	the doctors. yeah by by a significant amount. um and then it is like right now already people look at doctors as if they are like you go it is like getting your hair cut. like they look at the doctor like a parlor. I just need a checkup then I go home. like I am getting my haircut it is fine and a lot of people do not respect doctors as it is. and a lot of people are like you know universal in theory yeah it is a good thing like everyone gets healthcare right? and like I love that it is such a good thing but like the what it is doing to the doctors is like terrible. and no one sees that either because they do not they do not put it on the news or anything but like we we are my family is hurting this year and like just to pay for my education but we are still classified as middle class so I do not get grants or anything. so I mean we are not getting paid as much but then like tuition is rising and it is just I do not know it has been really stressful on my entire family just like this bill.
1	so you are you think we should not receive universal health care because of your personal experience of how that has affected your family's economic situation.
0	yeah and I mean a lot of other doctors too. I mean you you you want you are in bio engineering right? yeah so I do not know are you going into medicine? probably not. you are? I mean like I I was going into medicine I was a bio major when I was a freshman #. um and I switched because I was I I saw where it was going and my dad was like you do not you do not want to join medicine right now. psychologists going out there you are looking at like a twenty five increase in pay within the next what was it like twenty years they said? so I am like by the time I get my PhD I will be good but like doctors like they say they are wage is going down and um government is coming into um medicine and that is never a good thing #. like the quality is going to go down um of healthcare like everyone since everyone is going to get the exact same healthcare quality will go down and um doctors will not be paid as much and it it is going to be painful to get a doctor's appointment #.
1	so okay so I guess well of course I am kind of on the opposite side. I mean I am fairly like neutral but I would lean the other way. but then then my perspective is you are leaning it towards how like your personal opinions affected like how it has this medical bill would affect your family and how it has been affecting your family. but then in my perspective because I come from a completely different background and like what is it? I mean well first of all um my family does not necessarily receive like um we do not come from like a middle class or even definitely not high class but then we depend on like universal healthcare because like um if we get sick if we do not have it then how can we get the treatments we need or the medicines we need to get better? or any like if anything occurs and my mom needs surgery that would potentially like if she does not get it it could lead to an like something that could be like detrimental to her life. I mean I have seen the positive side of like universal healthcare and maybe not necessarily everyone needs it and some people can actually afford it so my opinion on that is like you could provide universal healthcare I think that is like a good thing but you may not necessarily need to impose it on everyone like for the people who do not want it or do not like need it they could provide for their own and
0	I mean I mean I would actually really agree with you on that one if we could do like a certain like income like then you would get healthcare but like right now I think with everyone I think that is just like ridiculous. #
1	I mean going back to what you were saying how like it affects the doctors and like their monetary status but then if you work all your life to become a doctor would not you want to do something? do it because you enjoy it and not because of the pay? I mean you want to like save lives and help people and alleviate like their stresses and stuff and not necessarily think about oh how much money can I get from this job. I mean it is like a hobby like any hobby you do it because you like it you love it and you enjoy the benefits of it. can not you see like the actual like um that like I guess in psychology the term is like the flowing which like if you engage in activities which increase like the yeah you know that it can increase your own level of happiness. I mean should not treating people and becoming like surgeons or primary caregivers or if I am using the right term but should not your main like reason behind that because you want to help people with their lives and not because of the money?
0	yeah I know what you are talking about.
0	in theory yeah. but when you when youa are a doctor you have to have an attorney on call twenty four seven because patients hear wrong information all the time and they sue you um that is not that is one thing. another thing is you are on call all the time and you are in the ER and you are dealing with people bleeding out and like frustrated people yelling at you. yeah you love the good days when a person you save their life once once every like month or two months when you save a life and you are like that was a great day yet yeah that is the flow you are talking about that is the good feeling that is why you love your job like in the end when when you can not afford to pay your attorney anymore and your patients are still suing you over falacies like it is just you know we we never yeah yeah exactly and then um and you are being called at two or three AM because you know these people are sick or they need attention now or or even sometimes they are not sick they are just hypocondriacs and they need to see you like like on call all the time like like you love it in theory but it is just in in the actual moment like it is just you can not I do not know you I I believe you can not take away doctors' pay. #
1	I know about that
1	I think I think that is I mean I think that situation is actually just goals about like the structure of like america's healthcare in general there is other factors affecting it like but then I think you are going about like the other factors maybe we need more physicians and stuff like that versus what we are talking about is universal healthcare.
0	well the well right now it is it is impossible to get more physicians because I mean look at our tuition right now. or like we are rising and then like after this if you want to be a doctor which you are going into after you know medical school is like rigorous processes a and it is yeah expensive right and how are you going to pay for that? on top of all of these loans you have to take out for your medical school and undergraduate and you have to move on to um two years residency with like very minimal pay and then then you can be a doctor by the time you will be buried in debt and like I my dad was not we did not start off rich we were not always rich. he worked really hard to get to where he is today and like I can not I can not imagine someone wanting to take away his pay like and it is not like they are taking away his pay he does the same amount of work he did before and he is being paid even less. and it does not make sense to me.
1	# expensive too.
1	I mean I think like I said it goes about like that issue was about like the structure of like how many like physicians there are like available and then but then what we are talking about is like universal health care for like the basically the general population I mean when you weight like when you look at the people who actually need it there are I think a lot of people can not even afford it. I mean when you look at like the statistics I mean for people who come from families of poverty who can not afford like basic like basically going to the doctor or anything like that I mean
0	then they should have a then they should I think they should develop a program where if you can not pay for healthcare or you are having difficulty or struggling paying for healthcare then you apply to this program then they like then they help you right? I do not think it should be universal like where yeah government jumps in
1	yeah definitely. that is what I think too. I do not
