0	yeah i'm against it too
1	yeah how come you feel that way?
0	um well well i'm a christian for one so
1	i'm catholic
0	yeah okay so for yeah i don't believe that it's natural so it's not natural haha i mean it's just not right so that's why i disagree with it but i'm not i disagree with it but it's not like i'm going to hate people for it yeah so
1	yeah so i get you um yeah but however even though i'm not for it i still believe that because you know like emergency room when you get injured and stuff they'll let your wife see you or whatever i feel that they should let them go ahead you know because they're in a relationship and if they you know what marry they should be able to go and see them in the ER because
0	i feek like
0	they don't allow them to do that?
1	mm uh they don't the reason why the main reasons why uh have want to much to be married is because they don't have a lot of the rights that most people that are married have so for a while i believe yeah they shouldn't get i believe that they shouldn't get like have the term marriage because that should be between a man and a female the bible says it should only but i feel like they should have some of the rights that we have like marriage is the thing of the bible it shouldn't be you know how seperated church and state i feel like we should still have that okay they should have the rights but not the term
0	yeah haha
0	and that's what we're talking about now okay so your saying like the definition of marriage shouldn't remain the same but they should still be able to have certain things
1	but yeah
1	they have the rights that that we have because i don't feel it's fair they can't see their spouse in the ER because they don't have that
0	but i think that's a little stupid because like come on they're people too
1	ha ha [...] so uh and then i also well this can't be good i don't really know all the stuff with marriage like i know that's one of the main one but i don't really know but i'm not going to go look i don't think they get a tax break because we don't want them married
0	yeah i don't think they do that either
1	yeah i feel like
0	those things you think that they should get
1	yeah they should get that but you know the term marriage is from the bible it shouldn't stay like because i don't
0	but then the thing is then they will never get that because if if you don't and that's why i think the opposing would be like if being married is they need to have that because according to like certain laws or a majority of the laws in each state they can't they're not acceptable to have those rights so then you know what i'm saying it's like they do have to have um you know that title of being married in order for them to do even though we may think it's stupid they do have to have that and that's why it's really important to them um but i think i think for certain things yeah like that to me is kind of ridiculous with the ER but once you let i think once you allow gay couples to get married then what am i trying to say haha um i just think like i don't know it's really actually it's really hard to because certain things i don't know i just think that they're inhumane like they are [fallers] and that stuff um but yeah i don't know haha but i i yeah i don't agree with it becuase it's just it's not scientifically it's not natural and
1	and you can't have children
0	yeah so in the bible it's not natural so like god it's like an abomination for that's why i don't agree with it so
1	yeah i feel like it shouldn't be called marriage uh like okay one of my big things is if they want to get married inside the church your just trying the priest doesn't agree with it it's like your saying i don't know how this is going to come out it's like your saying yeah i know it's legal let me go ahead rub it in all of your alls faces and get married in a church i don't you can't get married in other places but like in the church it's like are you
0	inside the church haha
0	and you voilating our right you know yeah it's like your violating our right
0	yeah like
0	it's to me it's just like okay you talk about you know yeah being fair and violating other people's rights but just or violating your rights but then when you come into the church then it's like it's a mockery of yeah your mocking us of what we it's not just a building it's something else yeah church is where we pray it's where we do so it's like yeah no
1	being fair
1	what we believe in
1	it's yeah
1	seperation from church and state and no i don't think that's they're like fighting it and they're like that's not fair it's like well
0	for a reason haha
0	i think some people believe because i don't i don't really talk about this topic but certain people believe like i met christians um who believe that you know they should get married because uh they believe that it's they should have equal rights because of what this country stands for which is you know everybody's equal or everybody has the freedom of doing what they pleases it doesn't sound like what i say haha but i mean you know they have the right to do whatever they want so then according to america the place that we live in then they should um you know have the right to get married and that is technically they kind of have a point but at the same time it still contradicts with what you know god has says about marriage and all that stuff so i just thought that was it's not like their reason about it or their reasoning of it it makes perfect sense because what america holds is libertyhaving the um the right to have certain beliefs and take act on them so um they're actually technically kind of right when it comes to that and so um yeah i don't that's where i feel a little confused about this topic but i still there's still this like you know black and white type of thing because i yeah whatever i just disagree with it yeah
1	um let's see we can just read the other side's view alright i guess they can use the rights thing that we were talking about they don't have equal rights um they can say love is love but um yeah but when people say that i feel like it can let's be more specific because when we say love is love what if well some people are like objects you know have you heard that when like they marry bridges now you know things like that
0	no haha
