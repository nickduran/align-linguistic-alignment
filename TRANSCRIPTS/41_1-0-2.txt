1	i said it should
0	it should
0	why do you?
1	i said it should only because...
0	You should not just like go to jail ()?
1	That's true.
1	But I mean like if you've seen on the news and you're like- even though I'm like () stories you can see some living (like) lifestyle kind of thing. Like they have, I don't know, technically not all of them but especially like the richer ones they go to jail for fraud. A lot of the bigger ones they get probation, they don't get that much time in jail, or they just get released I think. Definitely for the smaller kind it's fine but the death penalty for-
0	() and it's more expensive for the state to kille someone.
1	That's true and it does take forever so that's one bad thing. It should be a lot faster if it was.
0	() you just die, it's like you're murdered.
1	What if it was like your parents or something.
0	I would want the person to suffer more (and) be in jail and () happen, get raped you know.
1	But don't you think that is also imoral? ()
0	() killing someone that's more imoral. If that individual killed my parents I would want them to suffer, not just have it easy and die. From my perspective.
1	Yeah, since it is so long the death penalty, say thoughout this time they are still in jail right, so those kind of things will happen, and in the end say the guy is like thirty he probably won't be on the death bed until () sixty or seventy or something, really old. For the most part it's (taking) () matter on misery maybe and that point of view if he's tired of being raped and totally- he's going to psycho after a long time and then in a way it's like taking him out his misery, right.
0	(by) killing him.
1	But what if it's from that view of helping him out. He's tired of-
0	Why would you want to help him out when he killed your parents?
1	I don't know, I guess it is life for a life. I don't know. So hard to talk about.
0	But yeah, I understand your perspective. I would want him to suffer (in/being in) isolation. () suffer.
1	If it's that route then I feel like it should be for life in jail not just like twenty years () it has to be forever. Like you're not going to come out at any time and no probation. Or no () I should say. It's my take on it.
0	So the (doc) tells he was in the (), they US () this year. (Can you) believe.
1	Don't remember.
0	() cost lot of tax dollars so I mean-
1	I think in the point of view tax dollars I think we waste more on other things that are useless rahter than just the death penalty (). There's a lot of waste in money, I guess I'm going off topic, but let's see.
0	Like other countries still use dealth penalty. We haven't (gone) from that age, because that's more in the ().
1	This is more- I guess it's more humane, but I think it's stille lethal injection, I'm not sure if it's changing. It's a hard topic.
0	(). The movie, I don't know what it's called, but it was about a guy in prison that was on death penalty and then this man who worked in the prison ()
1	This is an old movie? Like Green Mile?
0	Yeah, and he didn't want to kill him so he wet the towel. (rememeber that)
1	Yeah, I think it's a good one.
1	And that case it was just like-
0	He killed him either way.
1	That is more torture (still) with electricity.
0	It's on my (). I would (). I don't approve of death penalty. You still ()
1	Case by case basis I think. So I mean it just depends on what exactly the situation is. How extreme it should be taken.
1	Not much else to say.
0	Okay then you () death penalty.
1	Not really, I don't have a TV so I don't really watch news, if I do it's like catch up on the internet but I've been busy lately.
