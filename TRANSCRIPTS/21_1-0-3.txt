1	um I feel that the death penalty that there should be a death penalty in the in this state uh in the united states of america because people some people are just not meant to be lived like some people do terrible things like really terrible things and I think I feel in my heart that the death penalty is for some people like not all people but I feel like some people or a majority of the people that did like serving time is just not enough for people. people are still going to be crazy. people are still going to do um get out of jail and stuff or prison and still do the crazy things that they do so I believe like the death penalty I think that some people just really need it.
0	uh I kind of oppose that um I do not think it should be allowed but I agree that you are saying that some people really need it you know some people are just you know born to do crazy things but. I mean not born to do they they are not born to do that. I mean but their experiences the way they were grown and they had bad experiences and then they kind of turned into a bad way. I mean so kind of saying they are already suffering from it and but better thing is to just you know punish the patient instead of kind of I mean I am not saying that they should be going out I mean I am still saying that death penalty should be allowed but the life sentence should be still there for them and um should be kept strictly you know kind of. um at the same point if if you turn to cure them or anything if it is possible and the same time they should be kind of uh kept really strictly inside the prisons. um so they should um kind of realize how um. because I think if you are saying that it should be you know um if they have done a lot of crazy things you know a lot of murders and anything uh that they should be just um you know um give death penalty right away that does not kind of suffer them alot if that if
1	I am not saying death penalty right away I am saying like the three strikes. you know how there is three or that is life sentence but I am saying that if you like things terrible like like killed like ten people like killed a killed your whole family you still think that person should just have a life sentence instead of getting put to death? they put their own they put their own family to death like people other people are suffering. I do not believe I do not feel in my heart that like people that go to prison and jail because I have known people like like that oh they are suffering they are not suffering they are get they are probably suffering like food thing but they still have a roof over their head and stuff like that and I believe like prisons like. I am not saying death penalty is okay I am saying it is okay but basically like how the US is today like they spend over I do not know I think it is psychology I seen it I do not know which class I am taking this summer but like over two million or something dollars for prisons that they help people in so they need more room so I am saying that is what my thing just to like that is another that is another reason
0	# that if you are saying that you know some people need it but uh they do not they do not do that for you know if they have already um you know given death penalty they do not um kind of because there are always wrong cases too I mean they are really rare but what if the person did not really deserve it but what if it is still exists and the person really deserve it and the same point I mean I do not think it is that much of a a suffering for them if you would just kill them right away. I mean if they are kept in the prison I mean more strict rules if um say if the person was not any having any um like um any psychology issues or anything and he was totally okay before but you know all of a sudden you kill a lot of people and now you are given the death penalty but then it is just like he did all those things and now he is dead and there is not much of a suffering for him. um that is what kind of I believe I mean he should be kept in a prison and more strictly then you know I mean they could start giving him suffering in the prison if that person really deserved it but death penalty does not still sound kind of you know weaker for all the people because some people they deserve it
1	are very rare. rare.
1	but I do not think
1	I do not believe they should get suffering in the prison because I believe that is wrong but I believe like the death penalty like they should have that. like why would you want somebody in this world that is that is like killed all these people why would you still want that person in the world like that is all I am saying. but
0	yeah that that is what I am saying. but they should not be kept with other people. that is what I am saying. they should be kept really strictly you know just in their own cell or kind of on their own.
1	and how would they like you said they were going to get cured how would they be able to get cured if like they are already like there is no cure for like killing. there is no cure I mean maybe
0	no cure for killing but if they have done it since they have any kind of mental disorder or anything
1	I mean like how people they people get out and they say oh I served my time but som people still like it is like some people all they know is like jail life even though they killed someone and they got out or like that it is still it is still like
0	that is what I am saying that life if it is the case of death penalty they should not be let out but get to a life sentence instead of that penalty.
1	but then that would be more money that we are spending on prisons. like more and more. because there are going to be more people have all these other people coming in so we are going to have to build more prisons there is going to be more money and it is coming out of our taxes so I believe like
0	yeah I mean they spend more money on other you know or there is stupid things too but uh. but just because it is there. you know it is it is not fair with all the people that cannot do the death penalty right away.
1	I do not know I just think that the death penalty I just I do not know I just feel like the death penalty is for some people the majority of people that do what they do like because it is just I do not know uh I do not know a case but I am just saying a scenario some person like killed like uh like the virginia tech shooting like that guy should have death penalty he killed a whole bunch of people and I do not care it was like psychological problems but like I think he should have the death penalty because he killed all those people so I do not know I just
0	I mean yeah I mean if if your state of mind that says that that evens things out you know that that would even things out yeah but if I mean the people who you already killed that it is not like they they their even their family if it is killed I mean yeah they will give him kind of sense of you know yeah they got their revenge or anything but it is it is still not that much of a suffering I mean if the person really deserved it I think um that uh staying in the prison for the whole life and you know under really bad circumstances is much more you know suffering than just the death.
1	I am not saying it evens it out but it is justice served because how are you going to a life sentence
1	I mean
1	I do not think so because I still believe that basically life sentence is like you are going to have to feed that person and going to have to have somewhere to sleep and that is money like all this money that we could be spending on other things instead of prisons like for people poor people like those people we could be spending money on that the taxes that are given to the government we could be spending on that instead of spending it on prisons and having if you are saying life life sentence that means that we are going to have to build more prisons for people that instead of having the death
0	I am
0	well compared to that they do not I do not I do not I do not believe that I mean death penalty is not that you know that common either you know they do not just give the death penalty if there is a rare case of you know they really doing it then if it I mean they already have a thousand prisons if they increase a couple more it does not they do not spend that much money just on them. I mean they they should spend on the other people that you know that are not that that bad of a punishment but they do not spend that much more money I mean they already spend money on the other things. I do not think it would make a lot of difference if they they do that. I mean if because that one is not so common in the prison. they really happen so
1	I just feel in my heart that the death penalty is for some people. and I mean you are saying there are cases it is just like
0	yeah yeah again I am I am not saying that that they should not get punishment you know I am not saying you know they kill all the people and now they should we should feel pity for them I mean if they are mentally ill or anything I am I am not saying that they should they should be definitely punished but just just the death I think that is that is kind of that is kind of like easy way out for them I I believe so.
1	but you say you are saying basically you are saying that is the easy way out and they should be punished but who is going to punish them that is what I am saying. Jail? they are going to just beat them and keep beating them and beating and then they learn their lesson? you are saying punish. punish by how?
0	I do not no beating? no I would I would never say beating but I mean they if they are kept in the prison you know they are not allowed to talk to the other prisoners you know? and um
1	that would make them insane. like not having um
0	that is kind of something that then they deserve you know? if they do really stupid thing if they kill a lot of people then that kind of I think they deserve it should be based you know on how much of a big crime they did
