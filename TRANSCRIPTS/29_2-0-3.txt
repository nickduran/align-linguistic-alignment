1	okay so for me well since I'm a christian I don't like well we're no suppose believe in that but personally I think that yeah I'm kind of against it because it's abortionand killing a little kid but I feel like in certain situationsit should be okay depends on the situations though
0	I agree to an extent because I mean like you know that's like that's another life you know
1	no yeah
1	yeah that's what like that's how I feel like your killing a little kid it's a baby
0	like it's your choice and then like but there's other who could provide for it
1	but I feel like um I don't know I feel like in some situations like let's just say maybe the kid is going to kill you or like when like when your having a really bad pregnancy or let's say it like if a doctor told you that oh your kid's going to have these type of issues then going to die soon or they're going to suffer the rest of their life I personally wouldn't want to see or watch my kid suffer especially knowing to some extent they're knowing their suffering as well and I don't thinkI would want that for the kid especially if I don't know I feel like it's kind of selfish like your just like no you just stick around because your my kid but it's like they're like hurting and they're suffering so I feel like to extent the abortion is needed but if you know your kid is healthy don't abort ha ha
0	that's true
0	yeah so like
0	that's true so like in certain situations I gueas you can yea
1	yeah but like um teenagers having kids they should not have abortion at all I don't care if the parent let them or if they're old enough to decide unless they're eighteen and they're old enough to decide to abort I feel like they should not be able to have abortions because that was their responsibilty they know what they're getting into you need to take care of the kid or have someone else take care of it for you
0	exactly so just in a general sense right like if your like and it's detrimental to like the health you know like it's going to hurt the person or like anything then yeah like I would say like then you know in the end it's up to them like if it's going to kill the person it's up to them but if like the baby is going to suffer you know like that's true like why why it's like if you have a dog and like you know
1	why let it suffer or watch it suffer
1	yeah it's just dying and your like oh it's okay ha ha that's pretty messed up
0	like it's
0	right like if it gets hit by a car or something your not going to leave crippled for the rest of it's life and watch it suffer so yeah
1	I feel like in that sense abortionis like okay but I know like um abortion for like teens and stuff is no don't let them because it's their responsibility and they you of known what they got into to begin and so I feel like in some type of sense abortion should just not be
0	yeah yeah in most cases like abortion should not be aloud
1	which is like I feel like most abortions clinics make it like free to walk in oh yeah come on in like you can just do what you really want to yeah I feel like there should be a fee or something like you have to pay for that ha ha
0	they make it too easy
0	ha ha
0	[..] rich teenagers huh
1	right [...] I feel I don't know but yeah in some sense like abortion is really wrong because it is a life and it's really messed up I mean you want to be born I don't know maybe in your mind your like no ha ha we're all like obviously your going to want to be born at some extent but for certain situations abortion is key for surviving I mean the body naturally does it like if the pregnancy is not going well the body will either like you know the baby is still born or it's going your going to have an early pregnancy the baby is not going to be breathing or whatever because the body id like oh something is going bad so in some sense your body kind of naturally abortd babies if there's something going wrong so I feel like may be to some extent it's natural I don't know but only certain situations but I don't know what would the opposing say?
0	ha ha
0	ha ha
0	I don't know it seems like we're kind of just in the middle so I don't know
1	with the opposing what's that say the opposing group say that general abortion is just bad I don't care which situation it was you just shouldn't abort a kid what would you say?
0	I mean I would say well I mean yeah well it's the same thing your talking about with [...] would you want to see your child suffer for the rest of his life or would you not want to see it suffer so
1	yeah [..] but if they said like all abortions like abortion was good then they have something to say but [...] can you like no ha ha no in general no but ha ha but in certain terrible horrible horrible situations sure but I think there has to be some type of moderation or tweeking to do whatever law they want to go with whatever law is current at the moment yeah type of regulation even if it's just a fee or something it would probably help with rates of abortions and having kids whatever is going on but yeah I don't know abortion is pretty tricky it's kind of a tricky subject yeah I mean exactly like once your abortion your just like oh don't kill that kid or it's no one cares like it's kinf of like everybody is either on one side or the other but I think that time I found a place to be like in the middle like what if yeah I don't know I mean I guess if I said if the opposing group said that abortion was just bad in general and if I pulled the whole like the body aborts kids sometimes if it's not good for the body or whatever what do you think they would say?
0	like a regulation or something yeah
0	very tricky subject
0	yeah that true
1	because I've actually never said like I always had it in my mind but I never really said it to anyone because what are they going to thiink
0	yeah because then it's it's kind of I mean it kind of contradicts in a sense so
1	yeah in a sense it does but then it's just like I never though about that because I heard some say like oh like why like I couldn't like my I couldn't have like the pregnancy didn't go through or like it failed or whatever it's kind of like the body's way of getting rid of it maybe something didn't work out the body was like [impatient] ha just let it go or a miscarrige in some sense
0	yeah yeah because then it's like if it wasn't meant to be then it wasn't meant to be
1	[..] yeah if it wan't meant to me then it's not meant to be kind of like the will of god there you go so yeah it just depends on the situation
0	it's cool
1	I didn't I didn't realy notice that either until like you know we watched some of the stuff on tv I'm just like what what I can't believe this so it's yeah so maybe if [it probably be really] controversial if someone is like no abortion natural which obviously like in a medical sense no but in a natural body sense sure ha
0	I would only imagine if the body only provided it enough just
