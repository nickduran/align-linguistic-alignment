1	What's our stance? um I personally am for the legalization of gay marriage um not really for any ethical re well most ethical reasons not really from uh logic or political standpoint um i don't know how someone could argue against legalizing gay marriage um outside of the bible disagrees with it um but I what do you gotta say about that part?
0	I um typically
0	yeah right $
0	yeah it's a really no real it's it's not something that's black and white but it's easy to see what the nice thing and the the uh what I seen as the progressive thing people in order to have a society that's unified we should be able to we should be accepting everyone and not
1	[...] is a word to get [...] but I don't know about unified that kind of sounds off but yea I see what you mean
0	uh no one is ever gonna have he same views but we can atleast be happy wer uh in the United States with what we believe to be something that we deserve and one of those things that people feel they deserve and I feel that they should deserve is the right to marry whoever they want to be in love with whoever they want and we're taking that limiting them to anything less would would make them less human.
1	[...] but it would be treating them less than human or is it it will actually a part from the precivil war days slaves couldn't marry but um I uh my stance on this is simply uh the fact that there's any political argument we can make is that um a couple that is um same sex could not necessarily have a lot of the same benefits and rights its its clearly a bit more of an issue outside of just you know two people want ot be married to one another becasue they love eachother its its also um if one were to die they would want this person a person they love or whatever they want to be associated with to inherit whatever fortune they have um it's also a matter of if one of them becomes hospitalized and if the partner goes to try and visit that partner will not be allowed to visit the person so ther's that um I don't know where to take this
1	I um [...]
0	If they If they're if they're coming at us uh a reason they may use against us is um for them is saying that the bible says it and that's what our constitution was built off of that our founding fathers they were avid christians and one reason we could come back at them with one
1	That is mostly true but our founding fathers were also what's called diests they did not believe in active completely influential god they believed in a lot more distant god who didn't necessarily have the capability of changing what occurs in the worldhe created the world and at a certain point he stopped he let go he let humanity do what do what it wills that is what they believed um
0	in the end
0	and in them getting what they did use the bible uh they were using book of Leviticus and like many of the books in the bible uh they can be considered outdated
1	uh um what sounds outdated?
0	outdated uh appropriate to the current culture of today uh an example of something that we may see as outdated uh assuredly everyone could agree on it is uh if that can bring mold into a house any peroson with uh mold on them or in some type of vessel bring into the house that's the United States ungodly and uh although that sounds nasty we wouldn't uh say it's ungodly and a sin today and
1	oh yeah
1	um they
1	so what if it has mold or a mole
0	uh some type of moldy substance
1	uoh a modly substance
0	yeah yeah not like a birth mark
1	ok i um
0	yeah and so I'm correlating that to what uh some people can si per say as the thing that's not culturally out of date and that's Leviticus's uh text where it says um marriage should be with uh be with just a man and a women
1	I suppose that I suppose that um one argument we could make against if these are bible thumpers we're dealing with that's a crass term uh um is that all the bible can really say or has really said about sexuallity is that if done outside of the context of marriage is most certainly a sin where its establishes that homosexuallity is a sin I am not sure um I'm not saying that it doesn't but um what my understanding even the vatican uh the official [...] from all the members is that it is not a sin to be gay I don't know how recent this is but that's what my my understanding is
0	yeah recently
0	when I say recently I mean like within the decade because a decision like that compared to yeah compared to like the past
1	they would know they would know um so that's one thing we could say if someone would be saying the book the big book is all [...] we should allow it to be a great [...] in our decision in this subject matter um in this context uh so I don't really know how many people could bring up very logical or political positions of trying to uh trying uh decry legalizing gay marriage I I don't see that I don't see anyone I see most people agreeing with them I um It does seem as though people typically approach this from an ethical point of view and I'm guilty of the same thing and I really can't see I really can't think of any other political positions that I suppose I could take um in trying to defend the merits of gay marriage um off the top of my head uh ethical I guess uh only the argument of sex outside of the context of marriage is a sin and you are a sort of forcing a couple who is not allowed to get married to sort of commit a sin and that sin is kind of on you if you're saying no you can't get married um so that's one other reason someone could make
