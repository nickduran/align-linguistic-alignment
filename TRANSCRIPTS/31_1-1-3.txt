1	Uh I put um yes. But I was kind of indifferent to it. I just like when I read the question, I just automatically assumed like if they are if they have more income, and more um money available to them, then it would be right to tax them accordingly. Versus people who are um lower income or middle class income, and so that is basically what I said.
0	Uh, I think they they should not be because they are paying more taxes and subsequently like um other poor people who are you know do not have as much financial income, are being benefitted from those taxes that the richer people are paying, you know what I mean? But um I do not believe they should be taxed more, because we all are like they are working hard to earn that money, you know what I mean? So I mean if you are like really working hard to make your money or anything, you should not be paying for somebody else that may be or may not be working as hard as you are, kind of thing, you know what I mean? And um so yeah, I do not think they should be taxed more.
1	I do not I just thought it was like all relevant until like if you make less, you should be taxed less. If you make more a little bit more you should be taxed a little bit more, if you make a lot more, you should be taxed more just because um because uh like the majority of people who are rich like um they they are rich because of inheritance, or they are rich because they own companies, or rich because of this and yeah they all worked really hard, but the middle class works just as hard, but it is not constantly coming in whereas a lot of rich Americans like it is consistent and it is not that they have to continue working, whereas a middle class Americans will have to work their entire life. And the I from my understanding, the whole point of like paying taxes and stuff is to go into your cities and to go into your public schools and to go into um all of these things that everyone uses um and like for instance like my parents like we are middle class, they . Like worked like like double jobs to send me to private school, but they also payed their taxes for public school um you know, like taxes like that would go to things like public schools that we do not use, but it would it is still important for people who make less money than us to have that opportunity to go to that to go to public schools and to have like um like good roads and to have whatever it is that taxes um pay for.
0	Ah, yeah um I do not know, I guess I am trying to put myself on the rich peoples shoes kind of thing you know and it is like if I am working hard to make the amount of money that I am making, I do not think it would be fair for the government to kind of want to tax me more so that other people you know because there are a lot of people on welfare and other receiving other um economic incentives you know even, and so they spend that money for drugs, on other things you know what I mean? And So I do not think it is fair for like the rich people who are like perhaps working like really hard to be taxed more so that these people I am not saying that all people on welfare or whatever um are using the money for drugs but like I I have done a lot of um community service and stuff and I have seen what happens out there, you know what I mean? So a lot of these people, you go there and you try to help them and they are high on drugs, and they are receiving they are not working they are receiving um of this uh government monetary um help, you know what I mean? And and I do not think it would be fair for the rich people to to be taxed more so that these people can keep living the way that they are living. Because they are harming themselves and they are harming their their kids too in a way that they are not teaching them how to work, and they are just teaching them to rely on on wealthier Americans, you know what I mean? So
1	Yeah even though like I I do understand like uh like there is there are a good chunk of people who are on welfare and who do abuse the system or who use government funds and abuse it, I think that it is not necessarily a problem of taxation, it is more a problem of how to like um filter those out of the system. So I feel like have like taxing um richer Americans is not the problem, or is not something that that people should disagree on, but it is more on trying to solve the solution on like having um just like people who use drugs or people who do not need it and do apply for welfare and who are on the WHIP program or all these other different programs to be better filtered or um like found out before like they are like abusing it, I mean I know a lot of people or I do not know I think there was it was a something a lot of people were talking about about um drug testing for uh the welfare program. And um I do not know I think that would might be a better solution than not to tax, because maybe then that if that was not the case, would you maybe agree with like taxing more based on what your income?
0	Yeah I think there is a lot of loopholes like on the system, you know I think there are a lot of things that it in many ways the system does not work as efficiently as it should, you know and um there are people who are in desperate need of of the monetary help and and welfare is doing a a great job on that area, you know? But on the other part, there are those who are like you said abusing the system. And that is why I do not think it is fair for uh for the wealthier Americans who, perhaps they did inherit inherited the money or the property or and that is why they are part of the top 10 percent the 5 percent you know and and I do not think putting if I put myself in their shoes, I do not think I would be wanting to give something that was inherited to me because of that you know my grandma or whoever want made that money to that sacrifice, you know, to make to build that um to make that money and give it to me, I do not think it will be fair for the government to kind of take that part of the money away so that it can give it to to other people who may may be abusing the system, kind of thing.
1	Yeah and then also I think like um when we are taxed, I do not think it is like that much money where like that that is lost, because like we do like get a lot of it back in um our refund checks. So like, I do not think like I cannot think of a number of like what my parents pay right now for taxes or even how much I pay like as a as a whole, but I feel like it would not be that big of a issue for them to be taxed just a little bit more, because like in like like they are be they do have way more money so, being taxed just like a little bit more is not I do not think is that big of an issue, to to like, I do not think it would be that like that hurtful to them like income wise or financially.
0	mm yeah
0	I think it also depends on what the government means by “rich people” like in taxing they the wealthier more. Because I know that for middle income families, sometimes their taxes go up like way higher because we both for like rich people to get taxed more, you know what I mean? Like I know um a few people who are in that position right now and and their argument is “I I am single, I am working and the the government is taking all of my money away ” you know? “And I am not rich. I am not considered uh, rich. I do not think I am rich.” You know, haha. And he is like making 16 thousand dollars that year it is not not that much, you know and and he pretty much is arguing that her her his taxes are going way up, you know? And and his argument is “I am not rich” but the government says that thinks that I am rich because I am working I am middle income class and I do not I am a single person. And so I guess it depends on how you define “wealthier”. You know I um if you are talking about you know the 10th um percent than that is what should be considered the wealthiest, you know what I mean?
