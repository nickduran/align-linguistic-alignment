1	okay so what did you say?
0	so you know do not think it should be do not think it should be allowed.
0	because I mean it is I mean there is a lot there is a lot of issues especially a lot of issues especially with economically. um there is uh a lot of you there is obviously a lot of benefits to a lot of benefits to marriage and you know it is normally great for people to be able to receive these benefits. but by opening up the definition of marriage to include other people then you unfortunately get a situation where you you I you can get a lot of people that are marrying for economic incentive and I do not think that this should be really what this is all about. there is also a lot of issues with for example like a lot of a lot of immigrants will gain citizenship through marriage. like hell I mean I have friends that like received like proposals from people that are like in mexico and shit. hey can you marry me I am desperately needing needing citizenship so I am going to be deported in like a couple of months and you know my life is in danger and shit like that so you know. you know I mean it is a it is a funky issue and that like you know that is like another issue in itself but it just seems like gay marriage might not necessarily be promoting you know love and shit. it opens up to economic and legal issues.
1	oh yeah i can see that yeah
1	well like I definitely see your point of view but like I think where I am going from is I think if they have like a set rule where these this couple really are in love and it is actual like it is actual because they want to be married and have that union then they should be but I do not really see the whole issue where it is like just becuase you know he is a guy and I am a guy that situation we should not get married because like I have two of my best friends are gay and they would they are in like a very committed relationship and like the fact that they can not get married like with their significant other kind of sucks. and that like I am allowed to like whoever I marry like as in marry a man like if I marry him then it is allowed. I do no know like I definitely see yours where like people will like use it as like benefits and stuff like that. but I do not know because they really love each other. #
0	Yeah I know and it is sort of like the issue of whether or not these benefits should be there in the first place there is a lot of arguments about that in which case that kind of makes it a non-issue in as far as the you economics and perhaps legal standpoint. but I mean I I do not know there is also issues like whether or not it would be a happy environment for a kid. I mean just recently over the past couple of years you know you have had a lot of unfortunate billing incidents in where straight up also kids have commited suicide over their both for sexual orientation sexual orientation. and I think because of making fun of making fun of their their parents you know? like where is your daddy?
1	kay well I do not think so
1	oh oh yeah. well if they have like seriously if those kids have like the I have because I have I have another two friends that have gay parents like got like two gay like two dads. and they are completely fine and their like their views are like very open stuff like that and they see nothing wrong in in no one has ever bullied them for it. I think it depends on like what state they are in as well.
0	yeah definitely yeah definitely I think a lot of states some states are definitely more hostile than others.
1	they are so hostile. yeah but I think like coming from the fact that they grew up in california and everyone is like really accepting about it. yeah # they are so they are so accepting yeah. but I do not know like I just feel like the I know like the (m___) marriage entitles that should like people have you seen the video like on youtube where um this guy his partner like passed away it was a freak accident and he died and he had no right? like they were pretty much like married but they could not they could not legalize it. but he died and he had no say in like all the things his partner like his he could not go to the funeral he could not like say like where to bury him or anything. It was like really heartbreaking and they like really loved each other. yeah. yeah so that is why I was like I do not know that is where I see where it does not matter to me if you want to get married. but definitely like the legal people will use it just like now. like people like women and men will try to marry americans for a green card. it is like that.
0	yeah californians people from california are definitely a lot more open about it.
0	I mean perhaps I mean perhaps you know california is a great case in which perhaps it might be allowed might be allowed but the issue is in all the other states especially states in which there is a lot of public opinion against it. you know whether or not there should be um laws that in states you know this is allowed even though none of you like this idea. I mean it kind of shows there is a hostile environment in the first place.
1	the south yeah.
1	definitely. yeah. I do not know. #
0	you know perhaps these you know perhaps you know I mean perhaps you are able to deal with the stigma and kind of all the
1	yeah but well yeah if it is a very hostile but if they are here I am pretty sure like everyone accepts it like it is ok now. yeah but I am like yeah concerning about like because I know they do like they do a lot of research down in like it is more toward the south area because the east coast is is like they are pretty okay with it as well. I I a little bit a little bit okay but the south is like where people
0	yeah here it is not so much an issue.
0	definitely in the south and I think a lot of the midwest well you know it is rather central and that is the geographic actual that it
1	yeah they are very they are very very hostile about it. but I do not know. if if you raise a decent kid you should be able to get married. like if you can not like if you kid is fine with like your situation stuff like that how you just love other
0	eh kid does not really have a choice in it though. #
1	I know but like I just said like you like it is just the fact that like you should love like whoever of whatever gender you want. eh that is me # I think I think growing around like growing up with a lot of like people who are have been gay I mean that is why I have had that view for my whole life. so # I do not know.
0	but it is just economic it is just the economic and legal benefits that they um get from it. I mean also a lot of these benefits are specifically there because marriage is comes with comes with an expectation that you are going to have children and that is partially the reason for example why we have tax breaks for that because we expect that this couple will produce children and be able to take care of them. and you know I know like you know um homosexual couples can get you know adopt and foster but not all of them do so therefore that is partially why I think they also do not get the benefits and if they do get the benefits without having a child then that kind of brings up a bit of inequality there.
1	they adopt #
1	okay well yeah. that is true. but okay so like if there was no like economic like reasoning behind that would and just for pure because they want that union they want that what everyone else has would you accept like would you say it would be for you would be for like for gay marriage?
0	well I think I think it has to do with also public opinion as well because again in these in these hostile states I think that even legalizing gay marriage in these in these states especially when there is all sorts of public might even bring more backlash against the existing gay couples who already have problems.
1	yeah that would definitely cause
1	yeah I see but like I think states that are like truly accepting that they should have it legalized while other states I guess I mean those I just feel like I know it sucks it sucks but
0	there has to be a majority I feel.
