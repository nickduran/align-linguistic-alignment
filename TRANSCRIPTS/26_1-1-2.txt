0	how do you feel? #
1	well I feel a lot like like it should be like lowered because like people like drink like no matter like what you know? so I think it is better if it is like lowered. like that like way like like it would be like legal and you know like being illegal.
0	so I am on the other side of that. I think it should stay at twenty one. um the only reason I think it should be at twenty one is because like DUIs are really high I think I do not know you kind of get into the same kind of like yeah they will do it anyway but if it is twenty one then at least there is some kind of regulation there. we have to do this for eight minutes? #
1	wait what?
0	we just have to keep talking. # for eight minutes.
1	oh okay um I mean like people like they are going to like sneak like an alcohol and like they are kind of you know like drink like maybe like if if they are like in their like fifteen sixteen so if it is like eighteen then like maybe they will be like oh like I am like almost there. so I should so I will start when I am like eighteen. #
0	so I think there is like there is going to be this like rebel group no matter what age. the law says it is like if it is twenty one it is going to be the seventeen to twenty year olds that are going to be like partying. if we move it to eighteen it is going to be like the fifteen to seventeen year olds maybe and that is like high school age. so do we want high school kids who are just learning how to drive also to be able to not legally be able to drink but they are going to be triggered for that one almost old enough anyway like the college group is. um that is a concern I see. it is just with the drinking and driving. and I think with like the the cognitive development of like younger kids versus those twenty somethings it is it is a little bit different and I think that that is important
1	what if like they like drank with like supervision like like like people watched them you know. like like they like they like could like drink but like there is like a super like # I do not know like how to explain but like you know
0	with like their parents or with family
1	yeah like with their parents like they people around like them like that could like watch them.
0	yeah I do not know how much drinking like the fifteen to seventeen to I mean to eighteen group would drink with their parents. I do not know how much I think college students drink with their parents. Like would it even be considered like fun? or and how do you regulate that? do you have to have like the parents still buying the alcohol and can feed it to the kids? because they can still do that now anyway even if the law was twenty one.
1	um like what do you mean like like at a party or at home or
0	no like how would you say okay you can drink at eighteen but your mom has to be there? so how can how could law enforcement or how could they regulate that or make sure that that is happening because it is the same kind of thing now. like you can drink
1	kay I get it now
1	it is kind of impossible #. you can not really um # I mean
0	longest statement that is ever mad. # it is okay.
1	um you could like maybe let us see well you can not like have like a shop around like running around all the time um
0	because they have to learn how to be adults anyway and if they are being allowed to drink they should alread be considered an adult anyway.
0	what time are we at GP?
1	this is so hard. um
0	hm well alcohol is also relly bad for you.
1	yeah that is right it is bad for the health.
0	I do not know how it affects the brain and body when like a person developing but if they start younger I am guessing it will have a greater impact on that growth and development. I do not think I do not know I think I just sit really like on the twenty one side of it because my brother is getting ready to turn eighteen and I look at him and I am like no way dude # no way but
0	like if it is kind of like if an individual is going to go drink it is not that hard to get alcohol. I do not really know what the difference will be if we change the law by only three years. especially like in the whole course of a human life that is not very much and I am not even sure if it is worth putting the legislation through. like how expensive that would be and all the time and all the energy there I do not even know what the benefit would be except that these young kids would drink. but I do not know I think if you asked some parents too that would be way different.
1	*right. and the state is anyway if you are not twenty one like
1	they would have like a different view.
0	yeah. and if you asked different kinds of parents they would probably sit on different sides of the fence like us but
1	yeah. I do not know what to say #. um
0	can you think of any other benefits? that is what I am trying to
1	benefits of drinking? well like there are not any. um let us see. like do you know any benefits of drinking?
0	drinking at that age? no. that is why # that is like why change it if it is already the rule. and even twenty year olds twenty one year olds and to those young twenties like they have problems with drinking and driving like I definitely do not think those teen years can handle that more because if you think about I do not know that that growing up process from like the end of high school to now. like that is way different or even like the beginning of high school to the beginning of college is way different. there is just so much growth there that I do not think we should change it.
0	I do not know. probably like three minutes. two minutes. # woo hoo! re okay
1	one more? okay. would you like would you like let your like kids like drink at like an early age? like if they were eighteen?
0	if the law was changed to eighteen would I let my kids drink? I would have no say because they would be legal adults. so they could do whatever they wanted. kind of that was the way I was brought up. like you turn twenty one okay cool. (____) your wedding or whatever. and my I did drink with my parents I do drink with my parents but not to excess and I think that that is the issue like actually getting drunk rather than like drinking a glass of wine with whoever you are if you let I think if you let eighteen year olds drink it will be to excess instead of just like that health glass of wine a day. because that is also an issue. #
1	I chose the other topic now.
1	I really chose the opposite.
