1	Gay marriage
0	uhm okay so what I think is that I think gay people should be allowed to love each other and, you know, do whatever they want, like I have nothing against that. But I personally do not think that it should be called marriage. I think that they should like create their own little like separate like union called something else. I don't know, because I just feel like marriage is between a man and a woman, but I mean like I am not am not against like gay love or whatever. But yeah
1	Uh, I personally think that they should just get married. But most of the time, if gay people want to get married, it is for legal reasons like because when they go to the hospital, they want to be able to show their insurance. Because that is what you can do with your spouse, like when you are married like a heterosexual marriage. So uh if they were to create their own union, with the same rights you know, that would be alright. But I personally think that this separate but equal thing is very civil rights-esque, and I just think that they should be able to get like married and a marriage like the scientific like the phrase is basically like two people like becoming like a a person like a one entity, and becoming like just their lives are melded together. And that is basically what would happen if like they got like “unioned” or something, which is basically the same word. So calling it marriage is just is just a word. And your beliefs are still strong in that, so like I do not think we should create a different entity, I think they should just get married. Because it would take so much legal like jargon to start like that process, and just get letting them get married, they could start like their lives and we could just go on with ours.
0	Yeah, I do not know it is just I feel like I mean like, they could do the whole like same thing, like with the same insurance and the sharing all all the same like rights that regular married couples do, and stuff like that. But I mean , it is just the whole the whole ceremony in general is it is a very like religious thing, and that is
1	Well I am sure they would still have their ceremonies
0	Yeah I know, but I mean like the ceremony itself I think should be like completely different. Because it is just so it is so religious, and religion is already a really really sensitive topic. That I mean and a lot of religions do not even like gay people like you go if you go to like churches, I am being serious they like they talk “hella” shit about gay people and you are just sitting there like “What? This is a church? What?” So like, I do not know eh I think it would just make it all easier, and I think it would make like the extreme religious people more accepting if they like they did it like that.
1	Uh I I doubt they the extremists would be more accepting but um, people like gay people tend to have a a good way of hiding it, and religious like, what their religious backgrounds I know plenty of Christian gay people who want to get married who want to have that ceremony, because it means so much to them, but they are also so in love with someone of the opposite sex. And it is it is heart breaking because they really want that ceremony, their church will not allow them to. So they are of course they are going to have to find the another church because churches, you cannot really like you know command them to allow people to marry, no matter who they are. A church is like a privatized you know like place of worship. So, like they would have to find have to find a separate chapel, or something like that. So already, the like the Christians or the Muslims, they already have their own places of worship where only heterosexuals can get married. And, if a gay couple went said “I would like to get married in this church,” they would of course be ostracized. So there is already that, so it is so much to handle
0	probably not haha
0	Yeah. So then why don't they just create their own like then like a separate Muslim mosque for like gay people or like a separate because Muslims first of all they already separate men from women, so I mean it is just like
1	Well I think
1	that that is
1	Ah that that is a completely different topic and that is actually not true, but haha. Um but like I still think that just gay marriage should be allowed and calling it marriage is just a word and they should like they are not even going to be able to be married in certain churches already, probably places that they have worshiped and they have like be been religious and I I know plenty of people that are religious and are gay, and they are constantly like abused by their own like parents verbally and stuff like that. It is already so much to deal with, so why not just let them use that word?
0	I don’t know though because the word itself yeah it is just a word, but words can carry so much meaning itself, so I mean it is just I do not have anything against gay people, but I personally just do not think that they should be allowed to get married like that. I mean they should be allowed to
1	I know
1	Essentially they would be doing the same thing, they probably would even be carrying out the same ceremony and everything. It would just it would just be the a different word, like “union”.
0	yeah, see that bothers me
0	Yeah a different word, but not even I do not even think that they should be wearing rings like, I do not know. It is just it
1	Oh well the rings are just like everything is just a symbol of a symbol of a symbol like honestly
0	Yeah I do not know, it just really disturbs me
1	It there is just too many connections you can make, like I can see someone wearing a yamacha and assume that they are Jewish but they might just like the hat. Like I do not know you can not uh uh at this point in time you really can not assume things. Like I see people just like you can not assume that someone is gay by the way they dress or straight by the way they dress, it it is really hidden. And like the symbol of marriage is that the rings and everything like that, some people even choose to wear the ring around their neck because they just do not like want to just abide by the rules of traditional marriage. People are already countering traditional marriage for a long time. So I do not know, I just feel like it is useless to try to like I do not know discipline people to remain the same exact way, because we are constantly evolving and maybe like, I do not know I thought I always thought like gay marriage was just like like our evolution, like we are we are overpopulating so maybe they like our evolution is training us to not do that anymore. Like I do not know, there are so many scientific like reasons, it is just I do not it is just confusing haha.
0	I do not know that that was interesting, like you you really think that? It would be like like evolution, yeah? That is, I have never heard that, that is weird. But yeah Um
1	No, but there is constant arguments against it, so haha
1	How long have we been arguing? Haha
0	I do not know, not really arguing but yeah haha. Um, yeah I mean like gay people are cool. Like my one of my good friends like she came out to me and I was like “Whoa!” You know and that really, that hit home, because I used to be more extreme. Like, you know, I used to like not even like gay people at all. But then like when she came out to me, I was like “Okay.” You know what I mean? So I think that what people just have to experience is that it has to hit close like to home, yeah
1	It has to yeah it has to hit close to home. Like I I um It took some convincing, but I convinced my mom that my cousin was gay. Because like she kept like insulting people that were gay and I am like “You know you have a relative that is gay, right?”
0	Is your family like really religious?
1	Uh you know what, not religious. But they are anti like rights for a lot of things. And I am like “You cannot just do that!” You cannot not be religious and it like it is there choice. But I just find it like rude or some other word, to do that to people, when it does not even affect you. I like keeping people from getting married or having the same rights as other people, having the ability to you know, combine their income taxes, stuff like that stuff like the benefits of being married. Because in this country we have created benefits for being married, which is all honestly one of the worst things we could have done, because people are getting married just for the benefits. Um but like just unless we change that, gay people are going to want to get married. And it is not maybe not even for the benefits, it is just because they love each other and they want that union. And they want like their religion, like they grew up with it, and they are religious most some of the time, and they just want that to be part of their
0	oh wow!
