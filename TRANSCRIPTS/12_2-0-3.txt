0	My beliefs on gay marriage are um people should be able to marry whoever they want it can be the same sex um I believe it doesn't affect me at all so why would I and why would I um want to tell someone who to marry and who not to marry if it's their choice
1	Right and this life is not like they're we could make someone love someone that they don't want like they can marry whoever they want like you said because it's their life it's their choiceand it's who the want to be with who they love um I personally don't realy care either I don't care so um why should other people judge them for their choices if it's their life
0	yeah and then many people argue the bible oh but the bible says that is should be between a man and woman not everybody goes by the bible we have many religions now um so I would say um if those who run by the bible it would yeah they would strongly believe that but we have many athiests um and the the percent of athiests is going high its um it's going up so um that is I would say now that it's not very strong a strong source to use as your as your argument for for gay marriage and also um if it doesn't affect you then why would you even worry about what they're gonna do you're not gonna live with that person so
1	right and then on other for that that other people might say is that oh I don't want my children to see all of that you know and but then yet you could still keep your children away from all of that like your children are gonna learn um whatever you will teach them so it just goes from there and care and nourish and it shouldn't be a problem.
0	I agree and then bay marriage now well not gay marriage but like there's a lot of relationships now that when you go out in public you see a girl and a girl together a guy and a guy so it's become it's becoming like like a normal thing for us to see um so I think if if our children were to see that they would just I I think as the years go by it would just become something that that is like normal like as if we see a woman and a and a man together
1	that's true um also one other thing that that people might might argue is that um you gain [...] things that you want too when they get married they want to start a family everyone would say that's not right that's n ot how a marriage should be but then yet one makes makes it not right there's still another [...] so why couldn't they have a family as well
0	hm hm
0	and then also um the some people argue that they uh or the child needs a i don't know an example from a mother and a father but you usually in in gay or lesbian couples um one of them takes the role of the man and one of them take the role of the woman um it's just the physical parts wont be like the man's or like the woman's but if or if they can play that role or or even better then that would be perfectly fine with it for the child so I don't see why they shouldn't they should have allow gay gay marriages
1	yeah um also like why shouldn't they get around it they can't in the United States anywhere [...] and that's their their um their Americans too so they should have us [...] it as other people they shouldn't be excluded from from [...] just because of their sexual um likes
0	Ok and I think even more if you had a child and what it what would it bother you if your child asked you if they see a a gay couple and they asked you why are they together what would you answer to that?
1	because they love each other or they want to be with each other and this is I don't know if I would tell my child but like they should do that too because they probably have you know they're little so they still haven't you know developed their sexual likes but it would like you said it would eventually become um something usuual to see because this is things so common now that it's normal
0	yeah and also we have no control over what our child's goona like we don't know if they're gonna if if they're gonna like guys or girls so and then I feel like if they do by all means go ahead um it's not it's not my choice to control them they have thier own choices but they should be they should know what they're interested in and what they're not and at a good age I would have said that
