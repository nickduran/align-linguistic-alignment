0	Do you think they should lower the age to eighteen?
1	Um, yes they should.
0	I think they should too because I mean once your eighteen your an adult so if your allowed to have sex and your allowed to smoke and your allowed to go to like clubs and to like strip clubs or whatever, why are you not allowed to drink? And your allowed to do all those other things
1	And then your allowed to go to war and then why can't you drink?
0	Yeah your allowed to get a gun, why can't you drink? But guns can kill people but drinking it's going to affect you just, yeah. And then everybody does it anyway so like, it's like the age isn't even going to matter to them I mean if they want to drink they still drink.
1	like yourself
1	Yeah it's kind of like marijuana it's just, yeah so it's the same thing it's illegal and they still do it so they just should legalize it that way not a lot of kids or young adults are no more committing crimes.
0	it's illegal they still do it
0	Because anyways I feel like if they were to lower the age down I like a lot of teenagers drink because they're like oh well I'm not even allowed to drink so I feel cool and it's like well I'm allowed to drink now so there no point of drinking I mean the, like I don't feel cool anymore or whatever. I feel like a lot of them just do it because it's like oh I'm like a badass because I'm drinking and I'm still eighteeen.
1	Yeah and if they lower the age then maybe not a lot of kids, young adults will drink I guess they could get it if they want to.
0	would drink
0	they would be like oh well there's somebody
0	So I guess it'd be less attractive because they're going to be like oh I could get it by myself now, so
1	It'll create less struggle for the government and police and everything.
0	And then college students are those ones that mostly go out and party and were all eighteen and older so it should just be that they are allowed to drink because your an adult already you can make your own decisions so like, hey can you buy me, but I'm an adult I just can't buy beer but I can smoke and go to strip clubs and go to war, just yeah I think it's dumb too that it's, it's twenty-one what's, when your twenty-one what's the point of being twenty-one. Does that make a difference? Why twenty-one?
1	Yeah and then I feel there is less reason to ask someone, hey can you buy me some beer just
1	Do everything but drink, yeah it's dumb.
1	I mean now if it's going to be like that then just, everything to twenty-one.
0	make everything twenty-one
0	And make every wait to be an adult and then stop considering ourselves kids.
1	Yeah it's just dumb yeah
0	And what do you think like the opposing team would say to like go against.
1	Their immature well obviously we got okay the opposing team might say that because eighteen year olds are not mature but obviously we, we are mature because we graduated from high school so
0	because we're,
0	If we're mature enough to go to war so, so how are we not mature to drink. The fact that, that there a law that you can't drink until your twenty-one makes people want to drink because when your parents tell you you can't do this that just makes you want to do it, that makes you want to do it. And then when they tell you to go out and party you're just going to be like I don't really want to because they're like they already let me who cares. So like if you are allowed to drink I feel like people, kids, young adults would be like well whatever I really don't want to go buy beer right now they wouldn't think it would be cool anymore.
1	yeah and go to strip clubs
1	don't go out and party
1	It just be easier for everyone if you just lowered it
0	Like a lot of eighteen year olds do it because they think it's cool and I, once your like twenty-three or whatever you, you do it with like your family or whatever your just like your not showing off about it and if they would lower the law they're going to be like oh whatever I don't need to show off, yeah and then you can drink so can I. And they're allowed to buy cigarrettes, they're allowed to once your eighteen you can buy cigarrettes um they're yeah they're adults they can do whatever they want.
1	all the time
1	they don't need to show off, can
0	Ther're allowed to buy a house. Can't they buy a house when they're eighteen? Can't they start buying stuff? So why can't they drink?
1	They're allowed to be independent.
1	if they have money
1	I mean you don't need credit to drink. I just find that that's pointless that's what it is
0	Yeah I mean it's it's dumb it's better if you just lower the age down to eighteen because once your eighteen your an adult so what's the difference between all the things you can do now and drinking. What is twenty-one do to you that makes you be like oh your twenty-one your fine to drink? Oh they can say that like for those that oppose they could say that your cells your brain cells are still developing and if you drink it messes them up but if you smoke I'm pretty sure that messes them up too, yeah which is the same thing your allowed to smoke when your eighteen.
1	you could get cancer
1	I think and then beer totally more healthier than smoking well it's not healthy but it's not as bad you don't get cancer.
0	but it's bad for your liver
0	And then if your cells are still developing once your eighteen why are you allowed to like go to war like are even like mature enough to kill someone to fight for your country? And then it's not even, I don't know it's just I think it's dumb because your an adult you should be able to do what an adult does your allowed to get a license your allowed to drive
1	I don't know
1	But you can't drink, it's pointless.
0	Yeah or if your a reckless driver you can get your license if you pass your driving test or if your like a cautious drinker they not even going to tell hey you still can't drink
1	they could make a test of maturity so they can lower and have a license
0	have a license to drink. well they do have the medical card to smoke weed or why don't they do that with like beer. But that's like the biggest problem that they're not mature enough I'm pretty your they're mature enough because everybody's independent.
1	Yeah I think they should they should just lower it to eighteen not just make beer be super expensive.
0	Yes because college students do not have money they're going to be like oh I can't buy beer it's too expensive
1	I mean that's the problem that they don't want to give young adults beer or anything or alcohol they should just move it downso that way they don't need any they just you know, yeah, yeah and there's many things out there but they can do anything but drink.
0	put the prices up
0	Because really alcohol
