1	Well um
0	so are we gonna
1	so what are our opinions on this? uh should
0	I feel as if they're gonna come at us to ______ with typical uh issues on the thing against oh what do we stand? where do we stand? do you think they should be taxed more rich americans or taxed the same or taxed less?
1	taxed less
0	taxed less being they're instead of the main provider that they would
1	taxed the same um
1	yea in all honesty I don't i don't think that rich americans should be taxed more
0	I firmly agree
1	I I despise all notions of socialism. ehh I i don't want to see a person who asks for socialism to me is like you you were in a state where ok it sucks for a lot of people in America on economic or even for other reasons. when you're asking for socialism you're asking for everything to suck for everybody you're not asking for everything to be good for everybody that's a utopic hippy sort of existence but that's this is this is how I feel about it it's like no thats a step in the wrong directioneven if there are good rewards there are good arguments for socialism you're asking for short term benefits over long term benefits.
0	when we
0	$ Right
0	Right I
0	so far mm for the I think we should have three main points uh to have as a rebuttle to when they're if they're on the offense and they're coming to us we need to be able to respond to their issue so I think one issue socialism uh we could describe the negatives of socialism on that I would like I'd like to take on since you're uh you were stressing socialism I take on the idea of uh the free market and how uh government interfering with uh business um isn't my favorite idea and yea my reasoning for that is um uh
1	it's not mine iether
1	I don't know very much about that so I wouldn't be able to debate that
0	ok I can I can _____ you on that I did a uh a paper on that in english so basically the reason why uh I feel they shouldn't interfere is because the more their their taxes are accumulating they're wanting to put more and more businesses for example the healthcare ben uh the tax they're gonna be stipending to the um to the to to any tax for business um its so aroundin 2009 uh amazin.com made it so that you had to pay an extra 4% tax on your packaging whatever you sold this guy made annualy $100,000 uh each year off of amazon in the end he uh made far less and uh he is since he was an entrepreneur he started his own business and he was forced to move from california to another state because california is known for their high level of taxes so that that hurt someones pursuit of happiness which is constitutional um
1	I wouldn't call it a right but I would deffinitely call it a privilidge
0	right I agree and then uh uh pharmacy uh ok yeah so that's that's one other reason. and a third reason? do we have one?
1	a third reason um to vote to sort of try and vote uh dispell socialism and then to try and uh debunk it or
0	uh not for socialim but for well if you could consider their action
1	oh or a the the rate of rich people gettting taxed ok uh um a third point the problem is when you ask for a rich americans to be taxed who does the tax money that these rich americans are gonna get the money that you the govern the who is going to get this money? um I already uh I'm pretty sure pretty much everyone who has a brain and kind of keeps up with things knows that the both the federal and state governments are not very trustworthy in this day and age um so I can't be the one to really claim that if if we were going to allow rich americans to be taxed more than not rich americans um I don't know if that really would be putting the more money that the government would get to tax uh put to better use um you know just becasue just because like everyone is guna have more money doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna do better things with it you know um another problem I have with the whole tax the rich amer rich americans would be the cut off for what qualifies you as a rich american to my knowledge is if you make more than $100,000 a year that's the cut off. that's not a lot of money. If you ever make $100,000 a year you're not really going to get rich off of that but that apparantly is what constitutes a rich american tha that's what is gonna put you in that label of you make more money than a lot of other people you should be taxed more you don't make that much more money in the grand scheme of things than other people a year but but apparantly because
0	uh huh
0	that realm of
0	I understand yeah it's not fair
1	It's not It's got to do with fair it's just it doesn't seem right it really doesn't seem like its going that it make any benefits. one thing that I don't think anyone really wants to do is give the federal government which right now and in the past has not been shown to be very trustworthy and all that effective and that the way it should be we should never just blindly you know just blindly love um our countries politicians you know we should always be one to criticize constructively criticize
0	yeah take action
1	but but now but now I hear we have to give more money to the government which we already don't trust there's a bit of a double standard going on do we trust the government? if we do then if the government is trustworthy if it's honest then ok sure we um I guess we give them more money but from taxes but then I hear aabout things about um criminals who are in jail for drug offenses being more expensive to keep in jail than murders and child molesters I you know I I don't I don't want more money to go to war on drugs cause I don't believe that's effective at all um I don't I don't want money to be paid for for taxes on um that I don't want our tax money to be paying for portions ehich apparently is something that's going to happen um regardless of what's side of the issue you're on I don't want that um I I don't want it indeffinitely I I just I don't see the merit in giving right now anyway giving the government more of rich americans tax money I don't see the long term benefit.
0	utaking action is probably the more important part
