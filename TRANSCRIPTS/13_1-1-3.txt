1	um I like strongly feel that they it should be legalized. should totally be allowed. I am just saying.
0	mm I do not think they should legal.
1	okay why?
0	um well in religious views you know like there god made man and woman and them alone to create the human species and I think it is just completely wrong. um like yeah I found there is a love factor but it is just it is not right.
1	so is it not right because like god said it is not right? or because like that is what it says like on words?
0	yeah well
1	because it is like if you take the religious aspect or like take the religious aspect like god said that it is not right but god forgives all sins. so if you are going to consider sin he like will at the same time accept you for who you are you know? that is my take on it. I feel like even though it is like in a lot of religions not accepted and like against god's like original will like on that religion aspect I guess like if like god makes you who you are like if that person feels like they want to be with the same sex like then that that is god. like god made you who you are like that and he is going to accept you for that.
0	uh I would guess so but I think society is kind of just well they can be accepting of it now but it is still it is kind of disturbing. I mean they are just too out with it and the way they flaunt it I guess. they just I do not know. if if people want them to come across as like we can accept it then I guess do not be too open about it.
1	so in terms of society you think that society is now too accepting of it then?
0	well I know young kids now they are just they are whole they are all about it and that they want the acceptance and the changing of it but for the couples that are out there like some people do not find it right still. and when they when they are kissing and out there it is just it is too much to handle for people that are completely against it and like if they want us to be kind of like we will accept you then do not be too
1	so if if like a guy and guy are kissing in like in public like and that is disturbing and like is it disturbing because that is not what society is used to like because like I guess what is what do you mean by disturbing like like it grosses you out you do not like it?
0	well it is just not natural.
1	to you. like to them like that that is that is what feels natural right? so it is like if a girl and guy can kiss in public and that is okay and that is fine and them two are happy like why can not these other two people be happy just because they do not like what society does not like? you know? that is why I just think like it does not affect you personally like if we were to legalize like gay marriage like and if girl and girl wanted to get married like it would not affect that straight person's life. like so why not just like legalize it like even if you like if a straight person like were to like think it is wrong or to think it is not moral like against god's will like okay then like that is what you think like why not let them do what they want to think? in terms of legalization at least.
0	yeah. mm
1	in terms of legalizing
0	what about the decreased population?decrease in population?
1	like right now we are already becoming overpopulated. #
1	yeah that is totally like I see the cons in it like like in like how religion says like god wants like men and women to like recreate and stuff and like that is obviously not like physically possible but like they are coming up with so many ways like maybe it is not like the healthiest but putting chemicals in and doing all kinds of like sperm aid things or whatever. like adoption is like an option. um I do not know I just think there is like just as many like there are more pros for the people who are gay and lesbian than there are like cons for the people who are straight like it is not it is not it does not truly affecting their life like they might like what is the worst that they do is like they see something that is abnormal on the street? like that is the worst that can really happen. um I mean it I do not know what what is the worst as someone who is against it like what is the worst that can happen in your life if you see two like gay men getting married and they are on the street like holding hands like what is the worst that is affecting your life?
0	I guess nothing.
1	right. uh huh. so then even though you are against it it is disturbing you would you just because you personally as a person do not like it not let them get married and be happy? like is that I do not know that is what that is the take I take on it. okay so just because like I like I am a society person and do not feel that like that is right like I am not going to take away their happiness just because I want to marry this person and they want to marry that person. that is what makes us different. so just you know # regardless
0	I have nothing else. I do not know.
1	hm. let us see let us see. what else comes with legalizing it? do you know anyone else who is against it? against legalizing it?
1	why do you think parents are against it?
0	I guess it is it is their generation and I guess with them growing up is when the whole homosexuality actually became more knowingly and out. they just found it wrong like their take it is the whole man woman that is final. like they can do what they want but tradition and the whole aspect of life.
1	is true
1	yeah. like right now it seems like there is so many like gay people like coming out like I feel like it is kind of like a trend in some ways like some people are just doing it just to like do it and it is becoming more accepted in our society every day but um it is like I do not think I think when we are older like I do not think it is going to be like as big I do not know I feel like the past couple of years it has been like huge. that is when it is really coming out like everyone and their mom is like gay or whatever. I just feel like might as well like might as well legalize it like if these people truly like want to do what they want to do like why why stop them like what what is it really detrimenting to us like. I do not know in like in a couple like of our generation when our generation are parents like I do not think it is going to be as huge of a thing or even in a few years from now like it will always be there like people will always want to you know just everyone is different. that is why might as well let them do what they want.
