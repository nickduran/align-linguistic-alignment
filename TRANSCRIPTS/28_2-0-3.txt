0	uh with abortion I agree yes
1	that you should be able to
1	okay me too um you go first this time
0	ha ha
0	uh well I mean understand the other side of the argument that it's a life that we're taking away when we have abortions um at the same time I feel that it's like in my mind it's a cell it's not a human yet and by I guess if the person feels that they can not support the you know like the upcoming human being um or like any type of like support support system I being a parent I feel like they have the right to abort just because it because I'm looking at like in society like when parents don't take care of their child or they can't support them or like even if they do want to support them but they have work and all that stuff um eventually the child sometimes in a lot of cases you like they turn to criminals or like they can't do well in school or they're having a harder time to do so um and I feel like it sounds really bad but it to me it feels like they're like uh they made a drag to the society just because they can't take care of them and that they feel that they can't support them then I feel like they have the right to do that and yeah just because it's like a right like I can't tell you what to do so why is it yeah like what we talked about like I can't tell you what to do so why it is okay from telling you what you need to do when it's like something growing out of you
1	i know
1	yeah no I agree um I don't know the specifics because I don't remember everything but I do know that like depending on like where you are in your pregnancy like there are certain things that are developed and certain things that are not and um and I feel like if you take care of it turn if youe know obviously if you are like four or five months pregnant and your already like huge and all this stuff like I mean I feel like maybe like there are times where there could be complications to like your body like yourself from trying to get an abortion so like fare developed I think if you find out your pregnant and you know it was a mistake and you take care of it in a timely manner like you should be able to make that choice because um that like like fetus or cell you know it's like it's not feeling you know it's just the idea that people the people don't like that it's like it's a living thing and your like squashing the possibility of it you know which sounds really bad but all and all it's it's it's you like it's part of you and like I feel like you shouild have that right and um I also agree with you when you say that that like if somebody is in a bad situation who finds out they are pregnant and they don't want it but then they're forced to and um they child will end up in a bad situation or they will give it up for adoption but you never know what happens from there either you know um like it's just it's not like a set in stone like this is a good situation and it's not I don't feel like it's a good place to put anybody like I don't think it's fair for a future child either to be put in that kind of situation and it is your body so
0	ha ha
0	yeah I agree and plus also for me um I guess it's just yeah like you said like sometimes there are situation where you can't control it's just it's a bad situation that you can't so like why would you want to have that like you know and there are regualtions and there not like 100 percent sure either but I do know that at certain phases like certain stages you cannot like it's harder for you to just do an abortion and I do agree with that part in that stance just because that's actually when there's a child in you like how could you not make that decision earlier on until now that you all the sudden when there's an actual like life in you you just want to kill it like now your actually killing it
1	yeah there's has to be like when you find out like it's not like you just change your mind like halfway through or something like that's
0	yeah so I do agree with that regulation because I feel like we have regulations on things like animals or like how we treat certain things so um it makes sense for us to have that regulation on how you treat an actual living being in you because now that's like an acutal person now but in a sense where I feel it's a cell like it's not living yet um then I think that's okay becuase I mean you wouldn't say I mean a germ is still living like you wouldn't just keep it you know what I mean like that's like to me it's just a cell it's not an actual human being until it hits certain stages and that's when I think that actually not okay but at earlier stages yeah
1	yeah and I feel like um an opposing argument is that it's like really traumatic on the mother and um like abortions like they cause a lot of regret and they're like oh you'll regret it all this stuff but I feel like if a person is willing to put themselves in that situation willing to get an abortion then they must obviously have good enough reasons you know they're not just going to get an abortion because they have a happy family and they have a stable environment and they're done with school and they're married and that kind of stuff like they have reasons and if your reason you feel is good enough to go through something serious like that then I feel like there's no one do deny that to you
0	yeah plus it's not like it's super fun to have a mother going through an abortion like it actually hurts the body to do it like internally it hurts and damages the systems so I feel yeah I agree like she must have good reasoning for it yeah plus I think part of it is for me I know like different people have different aspects on anything and so you know for instance like I might no support abortion and you might support abortion then I feel like it's important for society to respect that you know that same aspect that no one can tell anyone what they have to do and especially if your not harming me by torsa so how is that I'm going to control what you can and cannot do and so I thin it is important that you know like obviously we're suppose to come up with things that we're arguing about but the same time um I do think that one of the points need to clarify like in general people should respect people's decisions and beliefs so why is it that you know you can't respect this belief when I am respecting your belief
1	yeah and she
1	ha ha
1	yeah like there's always going to be two sides to something you may go well your not going to be on both sides there's always going to be people who think it's wrong no matter what you do you know because you can't please both but I feel like the government is in charge of like being as moral as possible and like looking at things from a bigger perspective and try to stay true to all it's values and stuff with the constitution and all that stuff so I feel like it's their job to draw the line and like you know
0	yeah I do agree with that actually because I feel like the law is uh like a baseline for what things we can and cannot do and so I think by making it a law I'm not not hurting you or hurting society in anyway or like making anything negative upon anyone besides myself um I guess then there shouldn't really be a law for it to like regulate that and because there like different ways people it's not so much to like hurt themsleves like actually like you know not hurt anything but like there are many ways that I guess like unhealthy for a woman like because like I guess that would be part of their argument that it's unhealthy for the body right but there are many things that are unhealthy to the body that we're doing every day on a daily basis so like are we going to keep regulations on that also
