1	what is your opinion on this? #
0	I think the legal drinking age should be eighteen.
1	oh I do not think so. well I guess when you say if I was like under eighteen or under twenty one I am twenty but I feel like when I was like younger I wanted it to be but now that I have got older I have like completely changed my mind.
0	well when you think about it that way it is kind of when you become twenty one does the legal drinking age really matter to you? because you are already nah but when you turn twenty one though. like since you are already really close to that age yourself you start to care less about it because you are already there.
1	I am still I am still twenty. I am twenty. #
1	yeah but like being eighteen and young and in college I realize how reckless I am and how reckless a lot of people are. DUIs drunk driving and all that stuff like that.
0	well do not you have like a DD or you never do that
1	yeah some people do not though. that is the problem. because when you are that age. I can not I can I got to tell you I changed a lot through college and I have seen people change and it is like they get more mature after they have gone through like the college process usually around eight yeah some people do not but around eighteen you know that is when like people just get out of high school and then it is like woah college!
0	some people do not
0	well in other countries the legal drinking age is sometimes even fifteen or sixteen. and in those countries there is really not too much of a problem compared to america where you know how it is kind of like forbidden fruit right? since you are not allowed to do it it makes you want to do it so that actually causes the problem.
1	*yeah. oh that is true.
1	yeah I think that is what I want to say about that. but would that also lower like more like younger ones trying to do it like and go down to eighteen so more like sixteen year old are going to have to try it.
0	well it is kind of my idea of once you kind of change it then what sets the bar when you (___)
1	I really think if if they are going to lower the age then they would have to lower it slowly.
0	well I can see a progressive like going from twenty and then to like maybe nineteen or eighteen over time but not like instantly.
1	yeah but you do not jump it straight. okay yeah I agree with that. but I do not I do not think it should be lowered right away.
0	well I can see a progression of it rather than
1	I can already see a bunch of seniors in high school like woah!
0	like the senior picnic?
1	yeah! oh my god. I mean if they are going to do that then there would have to be like laws in school and stuff like that.
0	yeah well there has always been laws about just straight up you can not really have alcohol like like here even if you are twenty one like you are not allowed to have like it in the dorm or even in the class or anything like that. or a flask. not that I have done it. but yeah.
1	oh yeah you can not have alcohol in the dorms.
1	I was going to say something like off topic anyway #. but yeah I do not I do not think it should be lowered like directly.
0	like not instantly but progressively it can be. it just takes time.
1	this generation better like prove themselves worthy of it then # because yeah like
0	well that or it could be a huge mistake for the entire generation and we learn from it like the sixties and seventies.
1	oh yeah. very true.
0	# lots of things are learned from that generation.
1	it feels really wierd that we are in a lab setting #.
0	oh oh right. yeah.
1	but um okay so we we have made our points #.
1	come to an agreement. I am just imagining because it is true I mean in the real world there are no ages. no doubt that the DUI levels and stuff are going to go straight shooting up throught the roof and drunk driving incidents
0	well it depends on like that is why it is progressive. it should be. yeah.
1	yeah that is why I am saying it should be progressive but that is what is going to worry me a lot because um yeah you see in the news all the time you hear about people. and I do not know if you know people that have been it is like oh my god. they can not lower the drinking age you are so reckless. have you seen high schools nowadays like like my cousins are all like really young around high school but they are already all drinking and doing drugs. I am just like what the hell? #
0	one funny thing
0	there is worser drugs than drinking
1	yeah there is worser drugs but like I am I do not know what the rates are but I am pretty sure alcohol kills a lot.
0	it kills a lot more than all the other drugs.
1	it kills a lot more yeah. and now there is teen pregnancy and those girls are drinking too #. it is all bad. it is all bad.
0	good combination. good combination. yeah.
1	congratulations. #
0	last time when I actually did this study I sided with that should be twenty one but then it was more of like uh eighteen not that bad of a choice actually.
1	it is not that bad of a choice but it is just like
0	it just needs to be over time not instantly like every five years maybe changing seein if it is actually like getting a possitive effect or like a negative effect
1	yeah see like how is it doing if you lowered it to twenty how is it doing if you lower it to nineteen
0	the only thing is you need to wait for the long term effect just to see if it is actually worth it. but then you have to actually be testing it for that long term effect. so it could either be something that is really really good or something that goes bad. yeah and then if it goes horribly right then you are the guy who everyone is like yay or if it goes horribly bad everyone is like damn.
1	yeah it is that is a topic that is I do not know I am okay with just with that is one law that I will not touch. I would not like it is not something I am like super strong about like to go out there and protest for lower drinking age kind of thing. #
0	it is the law
0	# like the whole uh legalize marijuana thing where it was a few years back where people were um it was actually on the ballot or something like that.
1	yes on cannabis? #
0	yeah I did not vote at all because I did not even know there was voting that day and everything
1	yeah. I do that too when I like do not want to vote. if I have nothing in it I am not going to vote in it like.
0	also I kind of do not want to have to go to jury duty.
1	I have yet to be summoned and we are totally off topic. # but anyways.
1	how long do we have left?
0	oh because that was one of the other topics?
1	oh that was one of the other topics. I am going to say I am okay with it being legalized for those who really need it. like you need a prescription for it.
0	# i am guessing
0	well I think it should be legalized in that there is worser drugs out there such as alcohol. because marijuana like you can not OD on that.
1	you can not. but you can have a lot of psychological like disorders from that yeah it can affect you a lot and more long term than alcohol does I believe I think. no? # I think.
0	you can well it can affect the memory and things yeah.
0	well not really like the short term affects are around a month and the only problem with it really is since it is illegal people
1	but if you are a chronic user of it though.
0	no it is not going to affect you as much as if you are a chronic user of alcohol. because alcohol over all like and you know how people are dependent on it. # yeah.
1	oh that is nothing alcohol is alcohol is terrible. alcohol is really bad. #
1	yeah that would be a lot oh well I mean some people it would actually make them work more but it is all individual effects but I still like I think it is not an issue that it is not legalized.
0	you can actually get a DUI from driving on marijuana. yeah.
1	yeah it would still be under the influence. yeah. that is why I am like I do not think it is an issue that it like it is a really big issue that it should be legalized. again like again it is not something that I am going to go protest against. #
0	eh some day. we will find out what happens in the next like thirty years.
1	honestly knowing that this generation is coming in I feel like it is probably will be a lot of things are going to be in california it is
0	well is not it already in california though? but it is more just uh for medical needs.
1	yeah for medical needs which is I am totally okay with. Like I am okay with it being for medical needs. because then that way it can be kind of controlled. kind of.
0	well have you ever seen the southpark episode where they kind of make fun of the whole medical need where um a lot of people kind of pretend that they have like a problem so that they can actually get it?
1	people do that for um adderall
0	adderall? oh the whole
