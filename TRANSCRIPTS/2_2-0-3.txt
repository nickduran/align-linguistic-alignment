0	um I said yes that I think you should because it would help our economy a lot and if you have the resources you might as well give back to the community. I don't know what was your opinion?
1	uh huh
1	um I'm I'm kind of iffy because like just from my like my family point of view like my parents my dad makes a lot of money he's considered like top 3% but half of his income goes to taxes and so like you kinda like where we live cause we live in a really like a really wealthy area and so my dad we just bought a house and stuff like that so he is already like in debt with that and here he has to pay like i think like he pays like half more than half of his taxes or to his income to towards taxes and so i just said like it kind of depends because there's like people like oprah winfrey who make billions and like ya know even if half their income were to go they'd still have so much money left and so I was just kind of like it kind of depends on the situation because like what is like defined as rich for some people isn't defined as that so it kind of depends on the situation
0	it's ok if it's different
0	uh huh
0	uh huh
0	oh okay
0	$ yeah
0	yeah yeah
0	depends on the situation right
0	No I definitely I agree that they do need to define the idea of the rich definitely but i also think that there's a lot of um like you said like there oprah winfrey or whoever but I know that ther's a lot of people who kind of are just like they have a lot of money and so they're here and they kind of just mess around here and I feel like my mom makes a pretty good amount of money but um but because of that certain amount we don't get it really any financial aid because it's just on the cuspid and so but I have another sister going to college and all these different things so I just feel that if if they have that sort of income and resources than why not reach out and give it to the schools people who need it the dif diferent resources
1	yeah yeah
1	people needed
1	no I comepletely agree cause i get like i literally get nothing for financial aid um and so like with that my my other my I have a sister too who's about to go to college and so like that's a lot and with jsut buying a house with having to pay for two kids colleges and to pay taxes um it's a lot and my dad does like graveyard shifts so it's like really hard so like I just there just I think there's just so many people out there who are able to who are able to do all these things and do extra so it just it comes back to like what depends on how much money you make like what is defined as like rich enough to do that but I feel like a lot of rich people are able to like get lawyers to have them not pay for those taxes like they'll save part of their business or they'll say like they'll find a way to like um and it's a good concept I know like taxing rich Americans will help the economy and it helps other people but people are always gonna find a way to go around that law people always find a way to go around the laws and so I don't it's just yeah
0	me too
0	yeah $
0	Yeah I definitely yeah I think that but the thing is too I don't understand is that there's so much effort being put to fight it and so much financial resources that they are using out of their pockets to hire lawyers or or what not. Why not just pay the tax and your done? you know but theres a lot of people who have the resources and who who maybe buy extravagent things like you know the segway or something random you know that that's like well you could have fed you know a couple thousand family that you know so I just feel like I don't know I think that like you said I think I agree with you about the defining the rich terms of sense
1	I know
1	It's just greed
1	a lot of people yeah
1	yeah buit's kind of hard because it's just like I feel and then people would come to terms where it's like just it's not fair like if cauase like my dads considered 3%that seems like really really high but it's really not if you break it down um but there I mean there are still a lot of people there there's like I mean compared to how many poor people there are I mean there's like it's a lot less but the amount of money that like the filthy rich prople make can make up for the people who can't afford to pay more taxes so yeah
0	uh huh
0	Yea I definitely I agree and I think I just think cause like I said I have my mom makes a pretty good amount of money but I just feel I mean I have theres so especially especially in college you have so many kids who are just messing around and failing all of their classes and yet because they're you know they have a lot of money back home then it's they can just kind of yea right and it I don't think like for my self I'm working my butt off here and I it's just yea I don't think that's it when you have the resources like that when in a sense that um I feel like it should be kind of separated but at the same time I can understand how difficult it would be for the government to do that because you can't say well we're gonna we're gonna tax just these rich people and not these rich people
1	uh huh
1	buy their way into life yeah
1	so then it comes down to just likebeing fair um but there's like a lot of priorities I do agree um cause like where where I come from like a lot of kids like they just got whatever they wanted their entire life and they basically have a job waiting for them no matter if they fail out of school if they don't even go to college if they don't if they drop out of highschool there's still a job like money waiting for them and that's when it comes it just comes down to like fair being fair and just like how they're able to live a simple life when other people have to work for it um
0	and a lot of the times the people who work for it are the ones that aren't taking it for granted and then people who have everything at their finger tips kind of
1	yeah and I feel like people who have worked for their money and are really wealthy I feel like they are more willing to give it rather than people who just who grew up with it who have always had that like stability are less likely to like wana give taxes or like want to give away to charity or what not just cause like they're just so greedy and it's just what they've always known ya know
0	yeah no I agree I think but I definitely think its not time to speak something that they should try to give back in a certain group but if you have the moeny and they're on a gold toilet or something $ ya know then or you know they have a whole room for their dog just for their dog then it's kind of like ya know there's kids who don't have a bed who don't have clothes who don't have food why don't they get those resources you know but
1	yeah $
1	It's really hard to find those terms though like I don't know it I don't it's really i don't know um just like people are it's jsut hard to force people to give up thier money especially when there not willing to and then that;s when people find back roads and find back doors to get ya know to just let themselves out of it um but I feel like in the end like when that happens I feel like the people who don't make as much money but are still considered like pretty like wealthy have to make up for that loss so yeah
0	yeah I agree I agree $
