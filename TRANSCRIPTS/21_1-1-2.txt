1	um I think that it should not be lowered because um basically um when you are okay you are out of college you are out of highschool you are turning eighteen but you are still not mature enough. like the license you get at sixteen but still I think drinking is like a responsibility you have to take response in which in your actions because people they drink all the time and they get into car accidents because of drinking and I think that twenty one is a better age than eighteen even though they they are still going to do it anyways but it is like a lot of stuff out there like marijuana and stuff like that that still that it does not well like a lot of stuff that has to be you have to be twenty one you have to be twenty one to get into clubs so until older I do not know I just believe that you can not I do not know twenty one is a good age because I that that you are more mature and you are responsible enough instead of being
0	again that yeah I agree about the maturity but uh the clubs too but you know you still get into clubs for over eighteen too you know that is but they do not have they only have the compartments um and marijuana is not even like legalized even after over twenty one it is not like you can get it after twenty one but but yeah I got your point about the maturity maturity but again same thing um but but I believe that at at the point of eighteen um a person has at least that much of responsiblity if he is going to drink I mean if it is legalized I believe it should be because over eighteen people still get into accidents people still get over drunk you know. um so I guess it is like individual um their own individual state of mind that of how they are growing how their development is going to be. if a person is kind of grown to be really mature and really you know really had a good parenting and um all those other things that comes in um I do not believe that um you know he or she should not be that much of um that much trouble to of about the drinking. I think it should be there should be certainly more um mature about the about the drinking over eighteen too.
1	I know the eighteen and over but they you can not drink.
1	well I hear your point you are saying but for different if different parentings but some people like some parents are really stricter than others and some kinds when they get out they are like oh my parent never let me drink now I am eighteen I can be bad so they want to drinking get drunk and that leads to all kinds of like stuff so.
0	yeah but uh # I do not have much to say now. uh well still believe that of the opinion um I mean I still have a my cousin and everyone you know who are eighteen and above I mean um I have seen them grow and they are they had good parenting. Their parents were really strict you know they they do not allow them to do anything. thing that are kind of stupid or anything but um so um I am they are not they do not agree to drink but um but I mean they are that mature that they if you talk about drinking they still say that yeah it is bad for the health. I mean it is addictive you can die after doing it so if they already know that much of stuff for after eighteen so you know if it is legalized I mean they be confident about it I mean it is not like they they are going to go for the drinking if it is legalized over eighteen but you know if if they mature about it they know that the cause and the consequences of it so yeah.
1	um I do not know I just I just feel like it like it should be stay the stage it is because like it is like okay eighteen is when you you are adult so you get to do all the stuff and then twenty one is like the time oh I can get into clubs I can drink now even though people already have drank it is like that age that symbolizes so I think it should stay. so it like the moments like twenty one and eighteen. like sixteen get your driving license eighteen you are grown twenty one you drink. so I think it is like in the world how it I do not know to explain it.
0	yeah I got your point but uh yea but but as you saying that it is should stay the way it is but um I um as you know there are a lot of things there are a lot of rules that are bended and changed since the you know since our generation took from the past generation so um you know the state of mind and our our as I said that parenting and um the development it has been grown to kind of new to make more smart students and smart children you know? because um they are using a lot of um different techniques to kind of make them more mature and um um they would like put them into school before their age and all those things so. I mean all you know considering all those things I believe that there are I mean mature enough at the age of eighteen to just about the drinking cause and um and the thing um I am not saying that it they should be just um I mean um you know you know telling that yeah at the age of eighteen yeah you are good to go you know? you can go ahead and you can have drinks but um um um (___) uh um the the like the like if if it has to be lowered to eighteen um I believe that there should be more instructions and more um um what is the word? like you know more of not they should they should be get more knowledge about the about the drinking consequences if it is lowered to eighteen. I mean look as you said that it or age of twenty one they are um mature enough to go for the drinking I mean they are you know um they are into um they have a good sense of the body. they have knowledge about it but if it is lowered to eighteen they should uh should involve more knowledge and more instructions and I mean I do not think then that would bring any any disadvantage out of it.
1	I do not know I just feel like when you are eighteen you are still not mature. like you are out of high school it is like you are in that bubble. then when you go to college or whatever you do after eighteen it is like you are maturing and you have the years that add on when you turn twenty one that is like you you are more mature you experience life because in like high school it is all about like drama this drama that in college it is more you open up your eyes to more experiences to more different things than like just not just your individual friends. you have all these other type of friends all these type of different like groups and it is different college is more different than high school so I say like I am saying basically that it is more that is my opinion like then when you are twenty one you are more mature. eighteen you are still like you are mature not immature but like you are just still in that bubble phase like oh this has to be this way this has this way I have this but when you go to college and when you have the experience in life it opens up and I believe like twenty one is the age for it to be
0	but then I kind of believe that is not like everyone's case you know about the college and everything because uh at at point of eighteen they most other kids get graduated it is not that it is still in the school but but they do make a lot of other decisions too you know about the but I mean some students do not go to college too they like the university they decide about their major
1	I know they are not still in the school but they still have that mindset
1	yeah I am saying experience like going to job job corps. there is a whole bunch of different things like
0	that is why I am I mean if they are making now those other decisions if they are making of their own so about the drinking decision it is it is not like much different so they can make a decision about the drinking too if they want to if they want to drink and if they want to keep it to a minimum and if they want to you know just get drunk and knock themselves out but
1	but does not drinking come responsibility and consequences like you can die from drinking.
0	yeah I mean if they are told about the consequences like I said but if they are given more knowledge about it I mean they are making the decisions too about the job if they are going to just started university I mean there are some kids that have already decided the major at that point.
