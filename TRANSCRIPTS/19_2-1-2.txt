1	Do you want to start off or I'll start?
0	Okay well what do you think about abortion do you agree?
1	uh I agree that abortion is wrong just because um a person when they have intercourse they know what they're doing so the ability of one person when a woman is pregnant and she decides to abort a child I think that's not fair because it's not giving the child that's being developed in your stomach a life actually to have life and go on [...]
0	what about those people that uh that got raped? what do you say about that she didn't have a choice?
1	well then at the same time if somebody gets raped it's it's a it's a bad situation but they can always make a bad situation in to a good something good situation and raise a child still loving them
0	okay but don't you think like um what about girls girls who are sick who are if they have a kid they might die then what do you think about that do you think that's fair for the person when they have the choice of aborting and maybe living or do you think it's still selfish?
1	If if the child if the woman is sick and she is pregnant and if in the case you're saying that the woman the the child will still survive when she gives brith or she'l die
0	but but but what if she dies while giving birth yeah and then the child's not gonna have a mother and then who's gonna help who's gonna help the kid and their suffering of growing up without a mother
1	while giving birth?
1	I believe
1	I believe that the mom should still have the child even though she's gonna lose her life because she's already had a section of living her life so when the baby is born the baby will still be able to grow up and you know the sad fact is their mother is gone but that's why we have foster care and somebody that that can shape the child in some different way and progress and have a better life than their mother or the parents
1	um what else um
1	I believe [...] ok
0	what about if the mother is not gonna be able to give the kid a a good life like economically or educational wise then what do you say to that? do you think it's fair for the kid to go through?
1	there there's a lot of women that you know they have the choice to have an abortion but they don't and they have a kid and either way if they don't know how to uh have an a financial economic um background in raising the child they still do it it's somehow like owmen in Mexico had how many 10 children and they were still able to do it you know my mom's from from 10 children and she was able to come to America and still sustain her life so I believe that women should still have the kid it's their kid and raise them as well as they can
0	yeah and
0	you know I agree with you I I also don't a agree with abortion but at the same time I feel like somehow uh if the mother knows that she's not gonna be able to give the kid a good living and she's gonna end up putting the baby in foster care where it's not secure if he's gonna be ending up in a good family then I feel like in a way she has the right to abort if the kid's gonna be suffering his his or her own life uh
1	but yet life is already suffereable $ going through a transition yeah life is a struggle yeah yeah to push through and perservere that's what happens $
0	well it it it is I I I have to agree with that it it is you have to fight to get what you want but
0	yeah so I don't know I I agree with you I don't know uh agree on abortion because I feel it's a really selfish thing to do um but I I feel like uh well I base my opinion mostly on religion because I'm really religous and I know religion most religions find abortion to be not acceptable so uh that's where I base my opinion on and I feel like it's a really self centered thing to do cause you're only thinking about yourself you're not thinking about the kid but I feel like thinking about the life that you might be willing to give the kid is also really important because you don't want to have your kid suffer or go through days without eating because that's not humane for a mother to do so if the mom knows that she's not gonna be able to have their kid happy and a healthy then I feel like in a way she has the not the right but the uh option uh uh yeah I don't think it's a right to abort I think it's more of an option and I feel like regardless if girls abort then they're gonna be living with the guilt the rest of their life becuase they know they killed someone and they know uh but I don't know it's just it's that's my opinion uh but like I said I base most of my my most of my opinion on religion because I know religion does not support abortion
1	the option
1	[...] abortion and um
1	I support abortion only because if my I was in a case as well as my older brother where my mom was forced by her father to abort us but she didn't so that's why I'm here now so that's why I am pro-life because it's only a matter of time where yeah there are cases where moms can't there's a there's women that tend to fall into bad situations where they they prostitute to things like that that's still the kid or it can't you know support them fina you know do things that other moms do but somehow that helps the child in some sense in some other cases where they're actually in college you know cause there's foster kids that are in college I know one actually right now that's in the [...] center and she's doing great so
0	okay yeah
0	in a normal
0	but then again if you don't have the the parents support then but you think it's more of likely that a kid's gonna fall into bad habits and maybe go into drugs or gangs cause they don't have a support or uh guidance in their lives so
1	They might not have a guidance in their life but they're still making choices that you know what if they didn't get to make those choices they still get to have a life so they get to live and learn through their experiences yeah it's not it's not right to kill well it's not I don't know how to put this in words like I'm stuck um yeah I just believe pro-life is the way to go in situations even though a woman is in a shitty position just because she's getting the chance of her child and her to develop something that shemight not be ready for but you never know she might grow to love in some places
0	that's true that's true
0	yeah that's true
0	after all it's a living life so I mean we don't have the right to take a life a away even though a fetus it's debatable if it's alive or not it's still they're a compilation of cells and their cells are alive so I mean the fetus has to be alive and who who knows up until what point the fetus start living so I mean I feel like abortion is not uh exactly I mean yeah so there's no there's no way of knowing exactly when we start living so I feel like abortion shouldn't shouldn't happen or shouldn't be allowed uh and I feel like the people who who've done it or the people who are thinking about doing it the guilt can kill you a lot because it's it's so much you know you killed an indeffense living thing
1	we're all living organisms anyway
1	so when we start living
1	I think that
1	The per yea the person ends up living with the with their consequences and the guilt and and that
0	but there
0	not so much the consequence because people I mean if it was a teenage girl who got pregnant and didn't want to tell her parents uh and she'd got an abortion
