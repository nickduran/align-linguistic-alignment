0	Alright I think or yea I so I what I put down is that I I personally was strongly against it but I recognize that there were situations where it's necessary or not or maybe not necessary but a lot more reasonable than the other decission and that's basically that's what I put
1	that's what I think like I don't know if I would do it as a girl but I I'm against it but I think that depends on the person like everyone's entitled to their own opinion and well yea there is situations when in might be needed
0	that's uh
0	So I think a lot of people they would say i mean a lot of people who are pro with it pro-ch I don't I don't even know the terminology pro-life yeah um I think they say that like i don't know I feel like they are it's always really like cut clean like they always say like it it's there never situations where
1	yeah like a baby you can't take away life from someone ese
0	but and that that's and that's I mean like I think about it I think that's kind of a i don't know I think its kind of a strange argument because I mena I've I'm like a bio major and I'm taking a lot of bio and it's just like I mean all like all of sex cells are already potential life and like I just it just seems that like they're like drawing really fine lines where they really don't need to be and I feel like there are varity like I know there are situations where like sometimes I think this may have even been in a political debate that they say like rape victims even they don't think they should be able to carry out an abortions and I think that's ridiculous
1	I think they should
0	yeah definitely they should be able to cause like that's I think I just like it's not fair for like for any individual to have to like carry out a to term like a child that isn't even
1	its like they didn't even want it like from someone that yeah
0	didn't even have a choice even
0	and that that that's probably like my biggest concern with it
1	to be like raped I think another thing that's like when the baby or its like its sick or it's gonna come with like i don't know like into the world and not even make it like i think that's
0	Oh you mean like when they're when they're like when there's some flaw like some DNA flaw
1	yeah like really really big flaws
0	oh yeah yeah yeah where like or like when they can or they can like either deformities or they tell you like for sure like this baby like won't live for longer than 18 months or something yeah I definitely agree with that because I mean in my opinion like even though you're like getrid of that life
1	yeah I feel like you're gonna bring some like somone into this world to suffer
0	exactly and I think that's that's also those those are probably two fo my like biggest
1	yeah those are my biggest ones too
0	concerns um let's see are there any other situations um I can't think of any other huge situations um
1	I mean I just think that when it's not right it's just that when you're having like irresponsible sex and then you get pregnant like every six months and like oh I don't i don't wana have a baby like that no that's not acceptable.
0	where I think everybody
0	that's not an excuse
0	yeah I agree
0	but that's about it I can't think I can't think of any other points to the abortion argument that people will bring up um um and you see them all the time I just can't remember I think that's pretty much it
1	yeah and that well everybody is entitled to their own opinion and well it is the little responding
0	I think
0	I think I I I remember I'm trying to I'm vaguely recalling like some um some people are like there's some people argue are like if it's not some people argue that abortion is not like only the womans choice but als olike the man who's involved
1	I think I think it might be like if yeah well he is the dad so like half of that baby is his right
0	mm its
0	exactly and I don't like in terms of abortion I don't really know exactly how I feel about that becasue like even though like yea half of that kid could be mine like that doesn't mean that
1	Like that is the girl that's carrying the baby for nine months
0	exactly like I don't really have a say and its like alright so you have to carry out this baby and then so I think like yeah that that's also something that I don't agree with and that's about it
1	um let's see what else could we talk about?
0	let's see what would what would people try what would pro-life try to say?
1	they're jsut gonna say how like you cant defoy someones life that's pretty much it or like if you were raped that they baby doesn't have the [...] in it that they're not responsible for those but i mean if you're gonna bring a baby into this world let's say like the the girl was raped like obviously like if she doesn't want it and she still brings it into the world she's not gonna take care of it she not she's not gonna be responsible
0	that's true that's true
0	and like who's to say that like even if she wanted to be responsible like who says who's to say like this like girl isn't like still in school or like can't support it like can't not only like support it with family but with money like it's not cheap yeah it's not cheap and then secondly like for every for every um for every uh woman who has to like drop out of school or not work to like take care of a baby that's like each one of those women is one less person who can like become really well educated and like really strong part of the work force and like I and like contribute a lot more then they can and if they drop out and try to raise a family like prematurely
1	yeah they're not cheap
1	and obviously like if you're an educated parent or like you have more experience you're gonna raise your child better because you're gonna be more prepared or like if you're a teenager um your your kid is not gonna have like the same advantages
0	yeah I definitely agree with that
0	any other points that you those are pretty I mean the the abortion argument it's pretty yeah the abortion argument it's pretty clean cut like a lot of the other ones has a lot of debate room but this was a pretty clear cut one um
1	I know like the main ones
