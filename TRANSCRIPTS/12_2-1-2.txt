0	um I think well I am pro-choice on abortion um I think the girl should have a choice of whether she wants to keep it or not um why? because if you can not raise the child right why have the child. yes there is adoption but it's your child so why would you want to give it to another family to raise
1	That's true I agree with you becasue sometimes people don't have the resources to raise a child and then that child could end up um following their parent's steps and that coul lead to a bigger problem um so I think that abortion is good um I also think that likw you said um are some the person's the mother's choice to to have an abortion so why should they if it's their body and that's what they think is right for them and it's their life too so
0	and then other people might say oh but why would she even have sexual relationships and not know the consequences well yeah but everybody makes mistakes we're not all perfect so if if she got pregnant and she felt like it wasn't she wasn't ready or um she wouldn't be able to raise him right or have the the resources like you said then they they should have a choice they shouldn't have to keep it and then later make the child suffer too
1	yeah and
1	um also even though sometimes um people might say like oh if you have an abortion you'll regret it and you're going to be resentful all your life but if someone is putting their selves into that position then I'm pretty sure they they will um they are most likely to learn how to cope with it and I think they will know that that was gonna happen like it would just know and they wouldn't feel like that all the time about the abortion
0	And I feel like if you're not put in that position that the girl is you shouldn't be able to decide like what that they can do or not do with their body so I don't know unless you're in that position and you know what it takes to raise a child and you raise a child yourself then maybe you have um some what of a saying but other then that you're not gonna be the one with the child for the rest of your life raising him knowing that you have limited resources and knowing that becasue I believe if you want to be a mother you should want to give your child everything they want so if if you get pregnant at an age that you're not you're not ready then you should be able to have a choice of having an abortion or not
1	what I also like like I have friends that they say that um oh yeah I'ma have an abortion if I get pregnant right now because because of school and I'm not gonna be able to handle it and stuff so I think that's another good reason for today and even though people um with other points of views might think like oh you should if you said um I'll help you with the consequences about having sex but once again it's a choice
1	also um one of the things that from the other from toher points of view um they will say like well well don't abort the child but put it in in adoption or i don't know but sometimes that doesn't seem right too and that's why we need abortion to me a choice another thing could be that the child might come like with disabilities and probably the that person like the mother and the father of the child don't want to deal not deal but like don't want the child to go all through all of that their whole life so that might be another reason for to [...]for the womans who had abortion
0	also to us
0	and the one of the arguments that most um pro-lifes argue the ones that say they they should keep the baby they and should not have abortion um they only argue like they can put it through adoption and all that but once again like why would you keep why would you give your own blood to somebody else knowing that you could of like got rid of it and then like you know that when you're ready you can have one and then you keep it for yourself because I I think that you always have like that in like in you like saying oh my my child its its with another family and who knows how their doing so
1	that can be overwhelming and and then I think that will haunt you even more during life because I think it's gonna be thinking like oh where is my child like I would end up crying for to to find him cause
0	they just take him right off [...] and then some I so yeah I think I m not against
