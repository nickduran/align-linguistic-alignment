0	go ahead.
1	well what is your opinion?
0	I am pro life.
1	pro life?
1	um I am fairly neutral but I think if I had to choose it would be pro choice.
0	okay. why?
1	um because when you think about it um allowing a female to choose whether they want to keep their potential child or not it allows them to think about like circumstances in their life that may or may not be necessarily like beneficial it allows them to evaluate their life and see if if they do have this child would it be a good choice for the child and themselves considering their like environment
0	okay that makes sense but like I do not know I can not get past the fact that the whole like murder policy we have like you can not harm another human being um by the time they are seven months old they are able to like turn their head to like stimulate like if I yelled at someone's belly like they would turn their head and be like what was that or like if the mother drinks a lot of carrot juice like after the baby is born like they prefer carrot juice over like other like apple juice or whatever so like they are able to like hear and taste like they are like little people it is like murdering someone.
1	so you said like you said something about like seven months and how like a child can like become aware of their surroundings by seven months but then abortion occurs before even a child is born and your main stance is pro life and basically how these uh children seven month old children can experience like all these like their senses but then what is your definition of life? I mean when a what is it? when a egg is fertilized by sperm they are not seven months old automatically.
0	but but at the same time um like they do have neurological um feed back I do not know how I do not know how to put that in different terms. but they are able to let me like think about this for a second. um they have their own heartbeat and their own brainwave activity and it is just I can not I can not fathom taking away someone's life. you know without even giving them a chance or whatever.
1	I guess that goes to the um question of what is your definition of like I mean when like a zygote is formed there is not necessarily a heartbeat. or any neurological development yet. I mean it has just the egg has just been fertilized. I mean that is according to what you just said that does not necessarily fit the context of life.
0	but it is still taking away a life before it even has the chance to develop. like into a person well I mean technically it is still a person I just think that it is wrong to like who are we to take that away like to take that someone's life away before they even have a chance? I think pro life as in abort not abortion but adoption. like I think like you said environmental factors like it might not be suitable for a woman to have a child like maybe she is like low socioeconomic status and she can not take care of it or maybe she is in a bad situation like with the father um I do not think it is necessarily right to abort the child I think just like having the kid and put it up for adoption.
1	um do you think it is necessarily right to force a woman to have a child? what if she has a child but because of this attachment she has formed with this child she does not necessarily want to give up the child? I mean that is a future of basically difficulties that if she has the choice to choose to maybe like abort this child then she could have aborted this like life of difficulty not only for herself but her family members her maybe potential friends and even the child the potential it has.
0	you could say the same thing about aborting the child though like what if you know what if she comes from a really religious household and she wants to get rid of it but then the parents are like there is a falling out because of that like there is there is a lot of there are pros and cons to each side but like I mean my basic opinion is like you can not I just can not imagine taking away someone's life. like even if I were to like have a kid like I can not just take away someone else's life just because it is inconvenient for me.
1	would you can not you see or would you what if it is um what if someone sees it this way where if you force her to have a child it is taking away her life a sense of her life.
0	what do you mean?
1	so like if you take away a child from a mother or force them to have this child would not you can not you say that is basically forcing like taking a part of her life away from her?
0	I mean yes but she should have I mean there is consequence to your actions. you know like if you have unprotected sex and you do not like take care of your body the way you should you know there is going to be consequences to that action and you know she should have made that in the beginning like she should have gotten better protection or used a better condom # I do not I do not know. Yeah.
1	I mean there are like what is it there are like what if you do take those necessary precautions but unexpected events occur and a condom does not necessarily mean you have a one hundred percent guarantee that you can not get pregnant.
0	I mean let us say it is like an accident right? getting pregnant might be an accident in this case we are talking about. let us say like I got in a car accident. it is not like I am trying to find a good analogy for this. it is not the car's fault. like you know the driver stopped paying attention for like one second and like then there is just a huge accident that affects a lot of different people.
1	it is not the car's fault?
0	I am trying to think of a good analogy but like the just there are consequences to your action like regardless of whether they were on purpose or like if it was like a fluke thing like the condom broke or something right? like there are consequences and um sometimes like we do not get what we want and like but we that does not mean we need to take away someone's life just because it is inconvenient.
1	I think that just goes back to what is your definition of a life. I mean for when you described earlier a life is when like you said at first seven months and then you later defined it as when the child has a heartbeat. right.
0	well okay well once the zygote forms like that that is a person. they are in the development process of becoming a person. I think this is hard to debate about #. but um I just um I am just totally against it. bottom line #. yeah.
0	really awkward.
1	yes it is.
0	um but have you ever watched the movie Juno?
1	no I haven't. no.
0	oh you haven't? that is such a good movie where she is like she goes to the abortion clinic and she walks in and then and I will talk about actually I will move to the psychological implications of getting an abortion. like she goes to the clinic and she she is like what like two months at this point or one month. and then her friend is like outside the clinic and she is goes you can not do this abortion they have fingernails like they actually have fingernails and she freaks out and she leaves. but my whole point is my mom actually had a friend who got an abortion and and um every year on that calendar that she had an abortion she gets really depressed because I like I took away something from someone. like or I I inhibited or prevented this person from developing. like even if you are not necessarily killing someone or taking away a life because it is like you said a zygote or whatever like you are preventing them from developing and you are preventing the growth of that person. and it is I just do not find that morally right. yeah.
1	I guess um when you take it apart from the context of taking away a life can you say like um what about looking at the potential benefits of maybe like using that um zygote into like other areas such as research? and promoting like um maybe developing more knowledge or basically obtaining more knowledge of like diseases that people are actually facing?
0	oh we are talking about two different things though. we are we are that is stem cell research compared to abortion. because you can still I mean there are ways to do stem cell research without yeah. but like I am I am just talking about like the preventing of a developing life like preventing that life from continuing just because it is inconvenient for us.
1	I know but
1	that is true.
