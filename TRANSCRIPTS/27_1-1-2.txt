1	so yeah what do you think? yes or no?
0	um I think it is no.
0	no. no uh because um yeah like the rich actually are paying the tax rate which is stated like in law # so they should not be taxed more.
1	um I argued that they kind of should be taxed more because I do not know. I think you know it is a tough time for everybody and we are making budget cuts and you know the best way to tackle the deficit and approaching like cuts to programs and stuff like that is one cutting programs and taxing more so like I think the rich would bring in more revenue like and they probably are not going to be as hard hit as people that earn less. that is kind of like my thinking behind it.
0	. uh but like you know like now is like economy is not really good so the rich actually they are not making a lot of money. like they maybe they are losing money though. so if they are taxed more I think that is not fair to them.
1	uh it is technically well it is they are rich right? so they have some in reserve. and it is not like it is going to be like from now on it is going to be we are going to tax you more from the poor. it is only until I think the economy stabilizes a bit. which it might be a while it might be a decade I do not know. and I am not saying we should tax them by like twice as much or anything ridiculous like that. just a little bit you know? just
0	so you saying that like they should be taxed a little bit more now? like later on
1	no they just like for now. and then if the situation improves then you know okay then we should just cut back that is what I am thinking. just yeah.
0	# ok but this is kind of like a difficult time so what if like can we can they be taxed like more when the economy like gets better?
1	yeah I mean
0	like not now because um I do not know #
1	# well it is like I understand that like times are bad for everybody but it is uh they are earning like rich I think they are earning more so they should just pay a bit more. that is that is kind of yeah.
0	think yeah.
0	but what if like the rich actually they are losing money now so
1	if they are losing money?
0	yeah what if they are losing money?
1	well it is like what for business ventures or
0	they are rich. #
1	yeah yeah I mean how would they like losing money like they are out of work or
0	I do not know. #
1	I do not know you are just they are just losing money?
0	it is like it is not fair for the rich that are losing money.
1	okay well if like the way I view it would be um there would be terms and conditions with it. like if they are out of work or something or if they are reach a certain amount of debt or whatever they should be exempt or something because then it is starting to be problem. but if they do not fit any of those quotas or something then they should be taxed right? because if they are doing well and a bunch of people are not they should you know help out a little bit.
0	uh huh? #
1	it is yeah.
0	um yeah.
1	it is yeah.
0	# um let us talk about like um how would the government spend the money then? like if they if the rich like are taxed more yeah like because I think if they are taxed more um
1	ean spend the money?
1	taxed more? okay um
1	you do not want it to be spent on like ear marks or um on like salaries or stuff like that right? where it is like yeah like I do not know if it is applied to I do not know funding for firefighters or something that would work right? or paramedics or education because education has taken a huge hit right? what if we like if it is applied to education because would you think that would be a fair deal or something? yeah? no? yeah? it is kind of a loaded question right? because I do not know. public education it is taken quite a hit with budget cuts and stuff so that is kind of like the forefront on my mind. yeah. and yeah.
0	# um
1	I mean what like state and federal programs do you like? because you know taxes go towards that right? I'm
0	# yeah.
1	okay so I mean
0	okay um
1	like I I know what you are saying like you mm like I know it is a tough time for everybody but you know there is funding programs. there is the deficit if that money can be applied um to help deal with that like you know every little bit of income helps right? and
0	okay so how how do you like set the like how do you define the rich?
1	the rich?
1	um let us see here I guess we should look at how much like the family or unit like household unit is bringing in per year and then it should also be like how much they are in debt. like you know they mortgages and stuff like just kind of look at their past history. this would involve cooperating with um I guess the like if like the people that send their bills or their bank to see how well are they keeping up? is their credit score good? you know if it is if it is at a certain mark then you know I do not know the specifics on this but this is just numbers. like I if I was more prepared I would
