0	so lowering the drinking age
1	yeah I believe we should lower the drinking age from um 21 to 18 just because if you can sign up to fight for your country why can't you drink as well as like other countries like london I believe is it London or England? england they do have a lower drinking age and since we're their sister [...]
0	that's that's what I said
0	uh Lon England England England yeah there you go
0	I mean uh before it used to be 18 but apparently there was a lot of violence or a lot of collisions with uh cars $ and so they i they the government thinks that it 's because at 21 you're a little bit more mature and you have the you you you know a lot more baout drinking and the consequences it might bring uh but I do agree that if we have the right of going and fighting for our country we have the right of drinking at 18 uh because it's just it's it seems it's it's a stupid decision
1	with drinking $
1	but um
1	no but then as well you can be when your 18 you're trialed as an adult right? so you should be suppose if they say we're mature enough to be trialed as an adult at the age of 18 but even younger at the age of 16 somebody could still be tried as an adult for an action that they cause like how mature how mature do you think we can get
0	yeah that's true
0	yeah yeah that's true
0	yeah I mean if if people do stupid stuff with alcohol that's on them and they're gonna face the consequences why uh kill the the or not to kill but just like why punish everybody else and have them wait until 21 uh I think it's really stupid the way laws works sometimes but uh yea I do agree with you I mean I I that's the way I see it we have the right of going and killing people in other countries why don't we have the right of getting a cup of tequilla or something whatever you want to drink and just $ yeah pretty much so um
1	I can tell
1	we should have the right
1	and wash your problems away with that person right?$
1	yeah I believe the drinking age should be lowered though just because I see it as kids already try to find a way to drink at a younger age so it makes things even more dangerous younger you know just being able to [...]
0	It I I feel like because of the kids in highschool they're what 14, 15, 16? they see 21 as being like what like 6, 7 years away and they really can't wait if it was 18 that would be by the time they're seniors in highschool and they could exactly I mean uh just it's dumb but $
1	a little bit
1	they can care les about drinking and yeah
1	$ I think the law's dumb as well because it's funny when you're old that's way more foolish that you wouldn't be able to get drunk as an 18 year old when we drank as well ya know only depending on whether a person can hold their liquor or not it just depends yeah I don't know why they would set levels from 18 to 21 a four year difference when we're out here in college doing our own thing why can't we have the choice to go buy liquor $ and have some type of fun while we're struggling in college stressed out half of the time $
0	that's true
0	yeah that's true
0	oh yeah
0	Well me personally I'm already 21 and I honestly I don't buy alcohol becasue it it it's just never been like I've never actually liked alcohol because it it it wasnever influenced in my family I never saw alcohol in my family so but then again I I feel ike people have the right as soon as you're 18 you're already considered an adult then you should be you have the right of going and buying whatever you want alcohol
1	as much as you would want to
1	uh huh
1	whenever you want
1	you can buy cigarettes and cigarettes are way more legal thing than drinking alcohol drinking alcohol damages your your liver smoking cigarettes damages your lungs and then you get cancer which is worse so if your already letting us buy cigarettes that kill us why don't you just let us buy alcohol and either way it's the same thing they are both poisoness to your body but why not just make make make it free for all and open it open it up but I understand that the case that you're 21 and you rarely buy alcohol but I think you do that because you really have you're able to do it now
0	that's true that its the worst drug
0	thta's true
0	that's true
0	yeah that's true uh well I've never been the drinker kind of type here in college uh I've always been pretty much a party pooper if you wanna call it that but uh yeah I mean I see I used to see it in high schoo all the time people getting together and buying alcohol somehow and I feel like if you didn't
1	yeah $
1	we tend to find out ways already so why not just make it legal
0	yeah pretty much I meanit's like drugs I mean if you really want it you can find it somehow and and get it so uh
1	and sometimes the way you find it might be super horrible so making every [...] might eliminate that dangerous little connection and just have everything be safe yeah andI also think it should be lowered to 18 because there's a lot of kids that are getting alcohol poisoning or they're really intoxicated so when you come home to your parents you don't know what to say because sometimes the par the kids are just really frantic and they don't want their parents to know and so their parents don't have a way to help their child and some might just end up throwing up or dying because alcohol poisoning
0	opporable form of yeah
0	and I feel in a way it's worse to drink behind not behind but like like secretly from your parents because it's just it's worse becasue I don't know I feel like you don't know the limit uh uh I don't know it's just I feel like at 18 you're considered an adult you're more independent you can do whatever you want you face the consequences and people in highschool they they they're still protected by their parents but still they they they should have the right because I mean supposedly we're in a free country then why don't we have the freedom to buy alcohol at 18 you know um so
1	but then again i understand why they wouldn't lower it just because alcohol is a whole total different substance that messes with your brain and gives you transfers of dopamine which acts
0	but then again you can smoke when you're 18 you can buy cigarettes
1	but cigarettes only give you a sudden light-headed change it doesn't change your whole persona and like you are just totally whacked out most of the time its okay most of the time when somebody smokes they at least know what they did five minutes ago instead of somebody like totally wasted and trashed and they wake up the next day and like oh crap what the hell happened so yeah i understand why they wouldn't lower it but at the same time 21 year olds do the same thing so
0	yeah that's true that's true
0	but i agree do we really want alcohol people will go out and find it somehow one way or another and there is no way of stopping that so we might as well just lower the age limit and then and then they can face the consequences
1	to drink and there's something
1	i feel like if they lowered the the drinking age to say 18 years old would be a little more responsible with it because they won't find the you know the the issues when you tell a child no they tend to want do it more so i think that is like the 18 year olds if you give them the um privilige i don't think they'll take super advantage of it like you are 21 where you are not such a party person but yet you don't go out and buy alcohol every other weekend or every two weeks you know
0	yeah yeah that's true
0	even though i can i do not do it because it is just i want to say it is because i am responsible $ but yeah i mean i kinda see that the point of not lowering the age because 18 year olds tend to be really irresponsible uh but i mean
1	i don't think 18 year olds are irresponsible i just think they are going through a phase where they are living and learning form experiences$
