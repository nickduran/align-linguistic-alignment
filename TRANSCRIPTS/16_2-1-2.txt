0	ok um I'm really against abortion completely um
1	they take[...]
0	um I think it's wrong because it is drawing a person that has no choice in what their circumstances are um it's also against my religion and I just think that no matter what the circumstance is it's not the child's fault that it was brought in to that situation and so it should be given a chance to be either adopted or put in some sort of system
1	so an argument could be like one no matter what it's gonna be life you know even if you can have um it's not like out of the body it's still gonna be life no matter what yeah and then you said it's against your religion so that's against people's religion um different kinds of religion so it shouldn't be aloud either and then I agree that you could put it up for adoption like there's other options besides abortion so like keeping knowing that there's other options out there is that it option or giving it to other family members or something another
0	it's still alive
0	um I can't think of honestly other things to say but um
1	Like even even after like a few weeks like it has like body parts and everything that
0	It's still a person it's not just a [...]
1	#Like yeah it's not
1	There's not like evidence that shows that It can't feel anything
0	and um
1	and I think on top of that it could like hurt the woman's body
0	Oh there is the chances that most do need help and stuff like that so that could be your um counterargument that it could just result in
1	I think that it can like hurt it can change fertility like the woman wouldn't be able to have be pregnant again and I think I've I've heard that um people get abortions and then uh the doctors will accidentally leave lens inside the womb like it could get on her leg and that obviously like causes infections too.
0	um I also think becasue it is a blind procedure up to a certain point um it could just damage your um reproductive organs and so um that could cause later health issues um
1	we have it's live no matter what it's against people's religions it's bad for you like woman's body it could be bad for a woman's body and
1	oh there's options besides abortion
0	oh yeah
0	another one
0	[...] two minutes
1	um well I know like my mom when she got pregnant it was like an accident and she thought about having an abortion like she didn't I know that her familly convinced her not to and then I'm here $
0	$ well I mean they could be the great people in the world but um I don't know it's just it's not I don't think it's an option it's not right everybody deserves a chance at life
0	yeah $
0	um $
0	I know um
1	well we could think about like what would counterarguments say and what would we say against that
0	that's true um a counterargument is a woman's choice um it is the woman's choice it's not it's not what like is best for them
1	like the
1	so it's a woman's choice but it's not fair beacuse
0	they don't have a say in it
1	uyeah the baby doesn't have a choice
0	um it oh um I know people get abortions because the child potentially has some sort of genetic disorder like down syndrome but um
1	there's been cases where they think that the child will have down syndrome especially with older women then the child ends up not being down syndrome
0	so they aborted a perfectly healthy baby um there's also the argument that no matter if they do have that genetic disorder it's ok they it might be it might not be the best quality of life but it's they can mae the best of it I think that they can deal with a child with a little difficulty um I have no idea what could be another counter argument
1	an argument is that um like it's not life like a fetus isn't really life or like a blastisist isn't really life cause it's just cells It's still on a path to life so technically it is kind of
0	well but it but it
0	yeah and I think like at and early stage there's a heartbeat and it does form at the moment of conception it's life um [...]
1	$ um
1	the genetic one
0	oh the genetic place that we were um the
1	uwhat was the first one
1	the choice yeah
1	and then the it's not living
0	$ um
0	yeah would that be a counter oh
0	the [...] to a woman's health um I think that's when abortions are highly suggested because it um something I think it's becaus ethe woman is older and so it poses a risk to your health and so there's no way [...] can see that argument but it's the woman's choice whether not to have the abortion and it's kind of hard at that point I know because it's just like the baby dies or the baby lives
1	uh huh
1	but at the same time I would think
1	I would think that if you're body can't have the baby that it would like flush it out right so people [...] if their body isn't prepared to have a baby or can't have a baby so I feel like maybe if your bady can't have a baby wouldn't it kind of like take care of it so you don't really have to on your own do you see what I'm saying?
0	yeah I
1	Do you get what I'm saying?
0	yeah I get what you're saying
0	It's just one of those things that I worry about I don't care about
