1	Well I feel I mean I feel like uh marijuana is a, is a very a you know popular um, I guess substance even more popular than now than uh than alcohol. I know alot more people that smoke weed than they than drink, you know I mean I feel I feel like it has alot I mean I feel like it it has some harmful effects but
0	Like what?
1	I mean
0	Lung cancer. I mean that's genetic though right?
1	Yeah. But I mean for I mean, what I'm thinking is like their the way they think you know I think it makes them, slower. I don't know but I mean if if that I mean if that's their choice I feel like it should be like any choice, people can make because I feel I I personally feel alcohol would have a worse effect on the mind than marijuana.
0	That's true.
0	Right I totally agree with that and like even uh, like looking at statistics like it shows that alcohol is more harmful like it kills more people like in like car accidents than marijuana and you know and uh alcohol also like encourages more violent behavior you know? But I mean we're talking about marijuana here too but I'm just saying, you know why is alcohol $ legal when it's way more harmful than marijuana you know? I don't know if if I should be comparing those two but still I mean do you feel like we should be comparing those two? I mean, or should we just be talking about marijuana?
1	Well I mean I I think it's an interesting point to bring up because I mean uh, there was a similar uh like in the 20's there was a similar a a similar problem. Everyone was drinking and they made it illegal and actually I mean that just, that just made everything that made it alot everything worse, you know? The more people started drinking more problems were caused and um I feel I feel like um, the you know some of the problems that we have now with with marijuana if it was legalized would would go very similar and and have a similar effect as it did with Prohibition xxx
0	Right right and I'm thinking if we legalize marijuana that'll stop a lot of drug trafficking like it'll stop the cartels' like you know main staple uh that's something right? I don't know
1	Yeah definitely I was thinking that actually.
0	So, decriminalize marijuana now, now
1	Yeah. Yeah most people I know that I mean that smoke marijuana I mean they're, I mean in general I mean actually I think it makes people that are you know more you know more s more violent and serious it actually, eases their minds you know.
0	Su, right suppresses that violent or that aggression yeah. Yeah I kind of feel the same way too.
1	yeah definitely.
1	It definitely has it's benefits I I see that the I see more benefits in it than I see harm you know.
0	Right right that's true. Well...is there any more we can elaborate from that or are we just going to end on that?
1	Well I mean uh as a counter argument people might say that it's a gateway to, to other drugs. But um
0	Other drugs? Don't believe it
0	That's just a personal choice though
1	Yeah that is all that is a personal choice I mean, if you think about it I mean marijuana I mean has, it doesn't have the same effect as you know some of the more serious drugs like if you were to take marijuana I feel like that would I think I feel like most people that you know take it you know consistently I mean I don't think they would take think about trying something else I mean it's the people that are just experimenting with different things yeah, yeah. And I feel like people I mean marijuana doesn't have anything to do with that it's just something that they tried and then they tried something else that was more harmful.
0	Oh yeah yeah that's true.
0	Yeah. Yeah...what other arguments are there against marijuana? Hh...huh
1	I don't know. Well, I don't know I mean I I'm not very uh I'm not uh a big marijuana smoker but I do I do know a lot of people that that are and
0	So what's wrong?
0	Oh yeah me too yeah I I don't smoke it I just know people that smoke it. You know
1	Yeah and they're all I mean they're all they're all pretty they're all decent people, they're really they're really cool they're real nice you know.
0	Yeah they are. Yeah
0	Yeah. I think it's it's not the marijuana that makes you a crappy person but you know if you're crappy person you're already a crappy person to begin with, in the first place. So, yeah. Hm...
1	Yeah exactly.
0	So we still agree on this?
1	Yeah yeah, definitely.
0	Yeah, okay.
0	What else? ...Hm. Oh the only bad thing about marijuana is like if you smoke it you know? Like you inhale it and, you know it'll it can cause cancer in your lungs I guess. I mean that's but then there's other ways to like, you know take it in, like uh safely too you know you can ingest it and also the uh like compounds found in marijuana are like like stuff you normally find in your body anyways naturally so it's not really that harmful like, you know compared to like alcohol. I xxx
1	Tobacco tobacco is pretty horrible.
1	I mean but that's like, that's like almost uh, more harmful I mean that's it is more harmful than it is good like I feel like there is alot more benefits there is ben there is alot of benefits for marijuana that's why it's prescribed as medication, often.
0	Oh yeah
0	Yeah and just think about a lot of people that can benefit from it you know like people that are in like you know they have pain and they need like something to soothe that pain and, marijuana's there. You know so...
1	Yeah. Uh huh
1	Yeah definitely.
0	Hh...So how how long are we doing this for?
0	Two more minutes oh okay. Yeah...
1	Yeah #. Um...
1	Let me think... Do you think it would be you think it should be something that should be decided on a state level or, nationwide?
0	Maybe...aw dang that's good. Maybe just, see my opinion okay am I going to have a strong opinion on this? Maybe just, should we just go nationwide man. $
0	Sure why not? I mean I feel like they sh, yeah because de decriminalizing it would be alot better that way it'd be better for the prison system right? Like all those people in jail like just taking up space just for like, a little minor offense like marijuana like
1	Oh yeah
1	Uh huh
1	Yeah and that's a that's another huge problem that that brings up is the population of prisons and the amount of money that's spent on prisons. Per year? It's alot and that can help with that problem as well.
0	Right and also those people that like are convicted like they suffer even more like psychologically you know? If you've heard about that stuff.
1	. For sure.
1	Yeah. They probably come out of into society as you know worse people. Yeah, but that's a that's a that's another problem though but still it could happen this and that.
1	Probably another minute.
0	Yeah $
