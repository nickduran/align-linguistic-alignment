0	um but do you agree that marijuana should be legal or illegal?
1	I do not think that marijuana should be legalized because I feel like that would kind of uh give um those individuals who are not supposed to use it a reason to use it.
0	but they can still get it.
1	they can.
0	and they would still use it. so it should be legal?
1	well I guess if it is legalized then it would not really matter because people would still be getting it anyways. but if it was legalized it would give them a right to.
0	yes but um let us say. and I am assuming that a lot of younger kids or younger adult they do marijuana. um when we are young at that age we we are prone to do things that we are not supposed to do. if it is legal then they might just not do it because they are not attractive to something you know. that they are someone is getting away from them.
1	well what do you do if you have a situation where um there is an adult that is using it for medical reasons because they need it. and then there is another situation where there is younger kids who do not need to do it but they are doing it. and if you make it legal then that would give them the op or the um the freedom to go out and get it without getting in trouble for it. so how do you how do you stop that if it is legalized? would not that end up causing more problems?
0	because even if it is illegal they would still go ahead and they get it if they are so. if they are willing to do something they would always end up doing it in general and if someone if a kid is if he really wants to have marijuana even if it is legal or illegal he would go out and buy it. and there are so many ways to get marijuana. so why not make it legal and let them buy in a right way so they can actually go home and smoke or have marijuana and not probably get into accidents or so many other problems that they are probably getting into it because of it is being illegal.
1	so you are saying that it is okay for kids to go out and get marijuana? and get drunk and high and stuff when they should not be?
0	I mean if it is legal it is better because then they would know that they can easily tell other students or other peers or their parents that they are going to do it hence they have um safety available for them.
1	but what safety is available if they smoke marijuana especially if they are really younger kids?
0	then their parents can take care of them or their peers or someone else can be there for them so they can be safe or um usually when they are high they do not know what they are doing. they are just mentally and especially physically not stable. Especially when boys are doing it. um I think if it is legal uh they would less likely to get into fights or so many other issues like sexual violence and because they have a third person there to stop them.
1	so you are saying that if the children do it it is their parents' responsibility?
0	no it is their responsibility. it is just that I feel like when it is legal I am okay telling my mom I am going to do it or I am okay telling my peers. oh I am going to do marijuana. whereas if it is illegal then it is hard. I I would be scared to tell them I would be scared to share that secret.
1	but I would be more concerned like about the health of those children that choose to do it because not all of them. but not all of them are going to tell their parents so
0	because they are still going to do it even if it is illegal. That is yeah if you are saying it is the health issues like you know like chemical issues that we have in our body or whatever they are still going to do it either way. if it is illegal they would still do it.
1	but legalizing is just going to make it okay for them to do it so you are saying yeah it is okay kids you can you can go into a marijuana
0	eitherway the marijuana they are going to have it it is going to affect them in the same way hence let us just say it is okay to do it maybe that way they are less prone to it because they are because there is less attraction because something is available. when something is available you might not end up doing just because you know you can do it.
1	how would you feel if your child was smoking marijuana?
0	um as long as it tells me. but it is well as a mom I think our parents should be very under control. and if I told my kid not to smoke it and as long as he is five or ten he probably will not smoke just because I have a very high control over him. or even when he is fifteen I think he probably will not smoke because he is just not allowed to go out as much but once they.
1	what if they are a teenager? what if they are teenagers?
0	yeah once they start driving or once they hit that sixteen they have they will not listen to their mom because at that moment they do not even know what they are doing so they would. even if it is legal or illegal they would still go out and smoke.
1	so you would feel totally comfortable with your kid doing that at that age.
0	yeah. I mean I can stop him but I can not you can not control them. you can always tell them what is right and wrong um. even making it illegal you can not you are not stopping them. you are just telling them it is not a right thing to do. you are just prohibiting them. but that does not mean you are actually controlling their actions.
1	but would not it be better if there was some sort of a restriction on obtaining marijuana so that it would be harder for them to get it?
0	but they are not going to follow that restrictions. kids who are willing to do marjiuana they are not um they are not those rules do not matter to them. because if they really care about the um those rules then before even that they would care about their body and themselves and their health. if they are not worrying about their health then that one rule is not going to stop them from marijuana.
0	what are we doing?
1	so you think it should be legalized because people are already doing it and because they should be able to do it if they want to do it?
0	yeah and I think it would open business to a lot of people and maybe we would have less homeless or less people who are looking for jobs and they do not end up having jobs and then they that causes them um um depression and it is another way it just it would stop a lot of other problems too like depression.
1	but would not if everyone smoked marijuana would not that end up causing more problems?
0	it would.
1	especially for those who are using it for
0	but people who are but the thing is they are doing it illegal so we already have same amount of problems either way.
1	but would not that be increased if marijuana was legalized? what would we do then if everybody was just smoking everywhere? especially if they are doing it for no medical reasons.
0	um just because they can do it in front of people? um I think people that can cause problems but um but I feel like you mean like students and elders and kids and everyone of all age people they are doing it?
1	just the people that are doing it that they do not like the ones that are doing it like that does not really help their health. like they have a medical condition and they need marijuana to relieve the pain or something
0	I think there
0	yeah I think they would. um it just become something very normal to them. it is almost like drinking the tea in the morning. and this is how they would take it.
1	what if what if it hurts them?
