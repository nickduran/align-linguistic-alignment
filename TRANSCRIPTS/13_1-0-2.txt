1	how do you feel about marijuana being legalized? #
0	um well before I was completely for it but then I was kind of just thinking about it. it should be because I think it would be abused. I mean more than it is now people would use it I think once it is legalized it is just like oh we will just take advantage of it and just smoke it without worries.
1	and you do not think like I mean I do not know I think people are taking advantage of it now too. I think I like I think it should I guess because i feel like um like people a lot of people right now like do it just to do it as rebellious kind of acts. like hear them say oh like marijuana like I feel like if they were to legalize it it would not be like as big a deal kind of thing you know like so maybe it would not be abused as much as it is it would not be like as much of a like cool thing to do. it would just be like oh it is legal like so we do not have to do it. uh # what about when driving like what is up with that
0	that is kind of scary to think about because considering if you are high badly and everything goes really slow like you do not know if you are really driving at that speed or not.
1	yeah that is the only thing I would think about. it is cool if you want to chill and have fun and have marijuana but driving is a whole different story. be like you know a lot of people do it now like and I do not think that is ok. # uh about legalizing it think we should legalize it if anyone is ill kind of like it is now kind of. if you are sick you can just go in and get it?
0	yeah. I mean that is the only way it can be. it can either be for medicine or for pleasure.
0	or we could think about the economy.
1	is true
1	yeah so you think that it would benefit it?
1	yeah I agree. like if it were legal through like states and everything or like not underground like it is now it would be going towards the economy like you said instead of going toward random drug users. I mean salaries yeah. # uh so legalizing it hm.
0	i don't know
1	so I guess overall you would say no then? so um yeah.
0	I guess there is more up sides than down. I mean the only problem would be driving under the influence but yeah it is already abused now so
1	so if you were like to say like if you were to answer right now like should it be legalized yes or no you would say yes?
1	so then what if we were to say legalize it while driving what would you say?
1	yeah. I agree. yeah.
0	even walking is dangerous.
1	no walking while you are high you must say. no just kidding. sorry. what about carrying like because I think there is a rule about like you can only like have like if you like have it legalized like if you have a card or something think you can only have like an ounce I do not know how like to measure out weed but like um like how much can you have like on you? is that part of the rule? would you make that part of the rule?
0	yeah probably because I think if you have more than just that much then your abilities will get just like messed up completely more so if if you are limited in amount on you then it kind of helps to keep it stabalized.
1	yeah, that is true. but then you also have to think like some people like who do not smoke that often like could have more of an like hit or whatever and get super super high. as opposed to someone who smokes all the time and their tolerance goes up and have like a bunch of weed on them and like it would. I do not know there is so many factors to it. I just think the driving thing is just like the biggest no no. you know some people say they can drive high. I do not think it should be illegal. just the driving at least. having it should be whatever it is just like. # yeah #.
0	do you think it would help college students focus?
1	um some claim that it does. I do not know I. it helps college students focus? I think like in terms of like high school high school students and college students who like smoke a lot I think a lot of them is the whole like the peer pressure thing and like the look of it like oh let us go smoke dude like that is so cool you know? like I think that is a big reason why a lot of people do it and like it kind of has like to do with alcohol like I think a lot of people also like to use alcohol as a drug like you can say like use it as a peer pressure thing like oh let us go drink and smoke because it is something we like in our minds you know us teenagers think like so rebellious like that oh like we are not allowed to do it so let us do it you know? and I think that if we were to legalize it like alcohol and um marijuana like people would not be as prone to do it because it just would not be as big of a deal. they would just be like oh like we could do that like we do not have to smoke then because whatever you know? That is why I guess why I think that in that sense of college students being able to smoke or focusing them more like maybe they would focus more with out it because they would not want to go and do other things such as smoke so badly. uh it is just a take. do you think it would help them?
0	only as stress reliever.
1	yeah I mean oh totally. that is what it is supposed to be right? yeah definitely. that makes sense. it is a good point. yeah. um I feel like it is kind of a gateway drug though too. like if you just take marijuana enough then eventually you can like thinking ahead like oh like I can get super high or like then I then maybe I should try doing something else like you know it is like known as a gateway drug to other drugs. yeah I do not know. which I guess like also goes with the peer pressure thing though. because if you did not want to like smoke so badly to hang out with your friends like you would not get like so into it. like I know a lot of people that would never have smoked like if it was just them like but just the pressure around them and like other people they hang out with just kind of made them like oh whatever I guess I will smoke.
0	yeah and I think if it does get legalized then they can go back to now. but well because if it is legalized then it is like ok well we can smoke freely and we will smoke it but then maybe that is just not enough. so then they want to try something else. that is it. so then maybe it can cause the drug use to go higher with other substances.
1	yea that is true. the other thing about a lot of other substances is substances though is that it is not as easy to get. I mean I am sure I am sure it is but not as easy to get as like marijuana is. so even if like it is legal it would just be like I do not know so maybe if we made it legal everyone would be like yeah like let us all smoke but I think that would only last for so long. Like if we were to like all be like ok heck yeah like it is legal lets go do it! you know like so like after like a little bit we would
