0	Alright you start this one you started the last one er I started the last one.
1	Okay well um I believe that a women has rights to her own body and if she's pregnant, and does not feel like she can take care of the child, she should be able to safely get an abortion.
0	So okay so you say the a woman has the right to her own body, but is it not essentially not her body anymore if there is another person inside of her?
1	I do not think that a little bundle of cells is a person.
0	So you do not think you do not think that they are like that that little bundle of cells can feel
1	I think after the three after the three no after the three month mark, they start developing nerves. And that is when it can feel when the fetus can feel things.
0	But you do not I mean like, so you can literally see it within like a couple of weeks, like six weeks eight weeks, you know what I mean? And like they may not develop nerves by then, but you can still like see their heart beating and stuff. You I mean
1	Well my issue is not is not when a bundle of cells becomes a baby, my issue is if a person feels that they would not be fit as a parent and they do not feel that they can take care of themselves and their the the thing, the the baby that they are carrying, then I do not think that we should force them to. Because that child is not going to be brought into a safe home, that child will probably be born unhealthy because they are not being taken care of within the persons body. So if a person feels that they could remain pregnant and that baby up for adoption, that is a wonderful option. But I firmly believe in options, because
0	uh huh
0	uh huh
0	But why could why is not adoption an option though?
1	Adoption is an option!
0	Okay, well then so what is wrong with adoption like the option, haha?
1	Because some some girls like they get pregnant really early on and they just do not think they can take care of their bodies as well as they can for a child.
0	But is it not their responsibility to take care of their bodies, period? So should not they be held accountable, haha?
1	Sometimes it is it it is honestly an accident. Sometimes it is the fault of like faulty birth control, stuff like that. And it yeah, some girls are really just bad at being human beings. But I do no think we should hold a child accountable for that.
0	So you would rather just kill the child?
1	Well if the well if the child is not even a week old and the girl notices
0	But it is still it is still killing, it is still murder essentially. It
1	I I do not think it is murder because it
0	You are intentionally killing a human being, haha.
1	I think at three I think at three months the the child can be called a child. Aside from like a fetus or there is another word for it that I cannot even remember but there it is like a zygote or something. Yeah
0	I know I know what you are talking about, yeah. Yeah, a zygote! That is what it is. But again it is still, it is still a human. I mean like in the real world, would that be okay? To just chose to kill like another person? Because that is basically what you are doing.
1	"Well we already do that with death penalties but um with like I just believe that women should be able to get an abortion if they chose to have one. Like, they are already battling with the same ideas that you are, they already have that thought in their head that is like ""I could be killing a child that could be a great person."" But if they cannot get the abortion safely, then they are going to do it in their own way. They are going to drink gratuitious amounts of alcohol to have a miscarriage. They are going to kill the child a different way. I think"
0	But you do not know that for sure.
1	I know plenty of girls who have thought about it because they had no access to abortions where they are from.
0	But you do not know for sure. I mean like you do not know for sure that that is what all women are going to do, that they are going to purposely hurt themselves
1	What do you mean?
1	That is not what all women are going to do! Some women are like there are some rational and some irrational human beings and you cannot count on them all being rational.
0	No of course not! I mean that is why it should just be they have the baby and they can just give it away to someone, you know what I mean? Like that is not I mean yeah it is a big deal, but it is not it is not very hard.
1	Yeah but the Well, I have you been pregnant before? It is actually very difficult! I had to take care of a pregnant cousin of mine who was only 18. And she chose to have that child. She chose to go through with it, get be pregnant, have the baby, and put her up for adoption. Because she
0	And that is a great choice!
1	That was yeah well that is a good choice. And I think a good choice is if you cannot do that. If you are in school, you cannot handle being
0	But why could not you do that?
1	Because some people have to work for a living to stay alive.
0	I know plenty of people who work while they are pregnant, haha.
1	Well I I actually do not know many people like that. Because I know uh like two girls who decided to get an abortion because they have like heavy lifting jobs. That baby would have died.
0	Well I mean I work I work at a fast food restaurant. And I have co-workers that work pregnant all the time, and that is not the best conditions you want to work in, haha.
1	No that is not! And you know, they they they do have that option, here in California they do have that option to get an abortion after like before that 3 month mark. And I think like I strongly believe in having that that option. Because if you do not have the safe option of having an abortion, then you are going to do it a very unhealthy way. You are going to use like a hanger, you are going like maybe get so depressed that you kill yourself. So you are going to kill two human beings.
0	And if and if that person does end up hurting themselves, then that is their fault. Because again, they are responsible for their body, they are responsible for the child. And if that is what they want to do then I mean, I do not think it should be legal. But let them take it into their own hands. But it cannot like you cannot kill another human being, that is just wrong. To do, especially when they have no say. I mean like I understand a child, in that stage, cannot speak, you know what I mean? Like, cannot even
1	Well eh
1	Well it it can it cannot even think. It is literally just tissues.
0	Yeah it it cannot literally, consciously
0	But still I mean. To know that that is a little little baby, a little person, haha.
1	"Yeah and sometimes that is enough to get someone to care about it. But sometimes that is not enough. Sometimes people will think ""No, I need to get this thing out of me."" And I would rather them doing it safely then like in a very destructive way. I just think that having the option of an of an abortion like maybe it is better to have it in the case of like incest or rape or something like that. But like most of the time girls have no idea and that might be the fault of society itself, but otherwise I think it is just safer for abortion to be legal. And you know if a girl comes in like at an age of like 17 or 16 and she is pregnant it is the doctors job to tell her how to have safe sex. Because she probably might not even know at that stage. And if she does, then she is just an unfit person. Like that is just terrible to just go in and like like every 3 or 4 months like Oh, I need another abortion. Like they they actually monitor you, and they keep you from do they are like You should seriously stop having sex, or we're going to like"
0	And that that brings up to another point. What about people that do do that? Like they they have sex, unprotected sex, and they use it and they use it as like a sense of birth as a choice of birth control, almost.
1	That is incredibly rare! That is
1	That is incredibly rare. That is honestly the like the rarest thing I have only ever heard of like one documented case of that.
0	But yeah that that is the stuff that you have heard of though, like how can you cannot prove that that is incredibly rare. I am sure that people do that all the time, you know what I mean?
1	I I personally do not think so. I I worked at a Planned Parenthood for a while and um I just I think it is safer for people to have access to like safe sex to to know that like
0	"Well yeah safe sex, but if they have access to an abortion, then that means they that that people are more inclined to not have protected sex. Because then they know that ""Oh, well if I get pregnant, I can just get an abortion."""
1	Well do you know do you know painful it is to get an abortion? It is not it is not the easiest thing!
0	Well yeah, but I am pretty sure that plenty of people would rather get an abortion than actually have a baby haha. As far as pain goes
1	Well I am sure that is the case. But they could also spend a couple dollars every month for birth control that is now incredibly cheap.
0	It is free now actually, haha.
1	Yeah um uh well with health insurance. But you can also like like there is there is just many ways of like many varieties of birth control that girls can use, and some of them do not even know that because they live in like conservative cities or something like that. So I just think it would be like it would be safer to offer abortions. But that is like I think everyone should know that that is like a last like that is your last resort. Like if you have not thought of anything else
0	But a lot of people do not know that, that it is the last resort.
