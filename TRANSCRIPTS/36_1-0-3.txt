0	uh well I am against the death penalty
1	ok uh I am like not too sure I am sometimes I am like in the middle I think
0	what do you mean?
1	I mean I just uh I hear like because I mean I have learned in I do not know like I think I do not know if I am like misinformed or what but like I know like to be in jail like I guess the reason why is that like I have learned in like like through school that uh if people on like death row it takes years and years and years for their case to be reviewed and like finally you know and so that is like all those years that is like all the money it is like what? thirty thousand fourty thousand dollars a year just to keep an inmate in jail? and then the cost of killing someone is like I do not know millions so it is like is it I do not know like I again I am looking at like the cost of like of our money like California's money and I feel like so much of it is going to the prison system I just I am like totally whatever I think is most efficient and fair and like I do not know I do not know
0	millions or something like that yeah yeah
0	# haha
0	yeah I understand like you know you want to not have jails too full or whatever but uh I am definately in support of like you know the dignity in human life no matter what they have done or whatever but and even if that means uh solitary confinement if they are being kept food and water but really the bottom line for me is just like it is cheaper you know keep them alive it is more expensive to kill them you know? and I think I'm not sure about this but like doctors like it's not like doctors are not can not do that you know? like some doctors do that most doctors do not but like they will find a doctor that does do that and that is why it is so expensive it is because there are so few doctors that will kills someone
1	so so it is more expensive to kill somone than to keep them in jail for life?
0	yeah yeah it is like considerably more expensive so yeah
1	ok well see then that like because I was I was like ok well if you have someone in life for like fifty years I mean that is a lot of money but I mean if I just think like for certain people like that people that have like murdered uh and there is like serial killers out there uh I do not know it is very uh it is a very touchy subject I mean because there is people that have been in jail and end up changed their ways completely and then there is some people that are always you know like the antisocial people that will never have remorse for the stuff they did so I mean and then some people just rather be killed uh and be like you know just get this over with or try to kill themselves but uh
0	* then it is like yeah
0	* yeah
0	* yeah
0	* yeah
0	I remember seeing this thing uh there is like a billboard or like something on the internet but a billboard and it was like welcome to America like five percent of the world's population home of five percent of the world's population and twenty five percent of the world's inmates so I thought that was pretty crazy it is like a quarter of the world's inmates are Americans because there are people locking each locking ourselves up
1	* yeah
1	yeah and then definately also with like uh see like I am like I am in the middle so haha I am not like really strongly for or like against it I just I guess I have to do a little bit more research on it but uh I know that uh where was I going to go with this? uh what was I? uh that uh
0	I just feel like America should be a place to like it should be one of those like a country that prides itself on not killing people you know? come to this place we will not murder you you know? like you do not have to worry about the death penalty
1	oh I was going to say there is a lot of of people that have gone to uh have been killed and then later on they found out they were innocent so they say in uh uh they say that is is better to let uh let go of ten guilty people than to kill one innocent person so definately I mean I do not know what the like techonology now and like DNA that we can you know find people to be innocent more well of course it is going to be more easily you know? like well you know what I am trying to say?
0	found innocent yeah which is even worse
0	yeah uh I feel like the the biggest thing is like uh just I do not know uh I lost it but just pretty much killing like sombody for us to like to kill somone and be like this is like your ultimate punishment to be like this is the bottom line as we are going to end your life with an injection I feel like having to spend the est of your life with yourself is kind of the worst punishment to depending on who you are if you are antisocial you can you can kill people and live with yourself but if you are sombody else and you have done that and your punishment is live the rest of your life out like
1	yeah because I know there is people that are like people of like uh uh family members of people that have been killed they they are like we do not want him to die we want him to live the rest of his life with that shame and regret that they did that and that is worst punishment than being killed so if you see it like that then you know that is a whole different thing uh but I do not I do not know I know currently in California do not we have we have the death penalty but it is not like no one has been killed
0	yeah exactly then you can not do anything because of that yeah
0	no one has been killed yeah I think there is like some people in death row but I do not think people have been killed in a long time or something and I think only like only like two people get killed a year I really have no idea but yeah yeah yeah
1	yeah it is like very very low and I know Texas for sure has the highest it is like do not do not commit a murder in uh but I mean I mean it is just I guess it depends I mean for some people they some families like I said they want them to live the rest of their life with like knowing that they can not get out or some other people might want them to be killed you know? I do not know I guess it it just depends
0	yeah I guess they will say case to case base but I still can not I cannot think of a case of anybody that like deserves to die through the the judicial system I do not understand people deserving to die from the perspective of another person in the heat of the moment things like that but from like the legal system from like the government being like we are going we have to kill this person ya know but I understand the person being like uh I have to kill this other person but for a system to be like oh this is what we have to do with this person now just kind of it is kind of like I do not know it does not seem wrong this is a place that America that defines its like that like prides itself on being moral and just you know? we will go out to other countries and help these other countries you know? it has always done that but yeah
1	* yeah
0	yeah see a lot of a lot of different things on it but I think bottom line is it is cheaper to keep them alive just keep them alive you know?
1	yeah well if if it from that perspective then
1	but there is definately uh I do not know
0	# haha
