0	um I don't think it should be lowered honestly um because I feel like people are younger people they don't really know how to like handle themselves with alcohol they just like over due it so and mainly um with drunk driving I feel like that would increase also if it was lowered
1	yeah like I know I read somewhere that um if they do lower it it's like more cost to the government It's like more taxes or something like that I was like yeah and yeah more drunk driving and yeah they're not mature at that age
0	yeah that's that was my main thing like even after like our age some people are like I'm I know we're not 21 but like honestly like you see that and its just like I don't think thye're mature enough to like handle themselves you know
1	and then opposing argument uh
0	um naw what would what would mm I guess they could say there's mature people that would be able to handle themselves um mm I'm not sure I didn't think about that I guess they could just like make more laws making sure like people have like designated drivers making sure people are like watched over that's all I could really think of I don't know $ I'm not sure but I don't know even if they said that I would still keep my opinion
1	I guess there wouldn't be that many teens getting into trouble cause I know a lot of people get busted for drinking underage and you know how a lot of people have parties and you're not aloud to buy alcohol for people under 21 but yeah I still [...]
0	okay oh no I see what you're saying though yeah that could definitely be an opposing view there would be less trouble I guess but I still feel like problems would be created there'd be more problems so yeah that's the only one I could think of
1	and what's the point of lowering it if people really want to drink they'll they'll find a way to do it
0	yeah that's true $ $ that's all I really have to say
1	so yeah
0	Um I said yes I don't really know how like the tax work but um I said yes mainly because um I feel like the middle class always ends up paying for taxes that's what I've just heard like I don't necessarily know but that's just what I've heard so yeah that's why I said yes
1	yeah cause I know they actually pay less taxes than everybody else and it's like yeah liek you said the middle class and lower class it's like they already they're like this is gonna bring the down more since they're paying more taxes and it's like why should you have to pay more when you don't have that much to begin with
0	yeah and it's like if the um upper class like if they have more money then they can
1	like it's not gonna hurt them to put a little more
0	yeah no exactly yeah but opposing views would obviously be that they shouldn't um lie mm I feel like they people would say like since they work so hard for their money like why should they have to pay extra tax and I don't know
1	the final
1	but people that are lower class are also working hard and they are still at the bottom more than yeah
0	yeah having to pay more
0	mm I guess people would say like it wouldn't be like ballanced if it was like only one class paying I don't know but still the middle class is yeah yeah
1	but the yeah they're already paying more the the upper class
0	I'm just trying to think of why people would say no
1	well obviously the upper class people would say no cause they don't wanna pay more
0	yeah they don't wanna spend more money
1	I don't know who else would oppose to that
0	yeah I would all see them opposing to it not liek lower class or middle class I would see them $ yeah saying yes
0	mm so I'm trying to think of like why the only thing I would think is that it's like it's always been like this so like that change somehow something would be unbalanced and I'm not sure even though I feel like now it's not balanced but yeah I just don't know like a lot about taxing
1	It's like it's been that way for so long that if you change it people are gonna be like why'd you change it it was fine the way it was
0	yeah yeah and it's like we've gotten used to it yeah mm I'm trying to think of other possibilities mm I guess maybe if the upper class did have to pay more um mm I don't know $ I doon't know can you think of anything?
1	wouldn't it end up benefitting the economy you know? they [...]
0	I'm not sure I don't know I wonder if it would I don't know but I know there's a reason why they haven't cause I feel like this has been a problem people have like proposed the idea but there has to be some reason why they haven't done it yet
