0	um Im a supporter of gay marriage um I'm guessing that you are too since we're discussing it um I think that it's they're human beings too they have thoughts an emotions and everything just like everybody else they're a normal person they just have different sexual preferences and you shouldn't be discriminated against because of that
1	I agree $ I think that um you aren't born with you don't you're born with whatever your sexual orientation you don't get to choose I don't know why people think it is a choice and then I think that I mean I know people who are against it um my dad's against it and he tells me marriage is a priviledge not a right I disagree with that I don't think that marriage is considered a privilidge that only straight people can have I think that marriage should be a right that a civil right in the government from the nation that everyone should atleast have
0	um I've I am best friends with trans people um I am straight my self but I can see how it does hurt to just walk down the street and have somebody tell you you can't be who you are because nbody else finds it right and nobody else has the right to actually do that and it's ridiculous that the government tries to um stop people from getting married just because they have a different view from them
1	yeah I remember when um prop 8 was passed and my academic decathalon coach was gay and he was and our vice principle was gay and they were like they started crying and it was really sad so I don't know I hope that I mean no one can work it's ok but I hope that in california they legalize it
0	I think in california it's the worst
1	and all I'm in the United states
0	m yeah thank god california is the [...] but yeah it but it is hard to um try to convince people who have been set in their ways um I'm catholic and I have been told my enire life that being gay is bad but I knew so many good gay people that it's really har to believe that they're bad and that they're going to go to hell if they're still great and I can't I can't really agree with someone if it's something I'm told because I see differently then what they try to tell me and um I think that if like you said it's it's it's a life um
1	I think that by saying you can't get married cause you're not like on this level with us you know you're not straight so you don't get this it's not It's like the same sort of discrimination it's like they had in like the 1960'swith black people I think that it's the same sort of thing like you're discriminizing yeah and I think that lik in 50 years we're gonna look back and be like what
0	Who they see as a
0	even before 50 years like gay people can't get married
1	but what would like be someof the counterarguments that
0	um the only one I can obviously think of is that um it is against the bible and because of [...] I haven't really heard any other ones as to why gay people can actually [...]
1	I would hear that um homosexuality isn't natural I I always hear that and then people think I guess people think that it's not natural so they must have chosen it you know what I mean? or they were conditioned into it maybe but it's not only prevalent in um humans its actually in yeah other types of animals too and I think science science um has showed that the reason why homosexuality could exist is that we have enough people we have enough like population and so we don't really need more like reproduction technically so that's why like homosexuality exists
0	in animals
0	$ but I was gonna say that it's present in animals too so it's not it is not a choice it's how they are they don't they dont choose to be like that um and
1	I can't imagine like being being told no you can't get married to the person you love like and that's just crazy cause I know other people think about it like their entire life their gonna get married and go off
0	it's ya know
0	you know
0	and then somebody throws this all in your face and says no you can't do it because you're different um I think it's like it's it's taking away a human right in a way um because they are human and they're just this big law it's just saying because you are not straight you can't get married and it's not fair
1	and I think that it tells gay people that hey you're wrong and on top of that I think that it kind of tells society like that gay people are wrong you know that since they can't get married they are wrong andon top of that that teaches young people that they're wrong and like they're just bullying like bullying it makes people commit suicide and all these type of things depression and so I think that that's bad too is even haing like a law that says they can't get married like it has like all kinds of like consequences involved
0	um and just the law it sounds um it's ridiculous it doesn't make much sense um it's just kind of biased and based on conservative thought which isn't fair because it's not the way that all people think um I had some of these and I completely forgot what I was gonna say
1	I don't know what another counter argument is
0	I wanna say that like when I heard the argument of um no that's not in favor of gay marriage duh um I honeslty can't remember anything else that can counter that um they're people too
1	yeah that's it
0	do you
1	I guess another argument is that it um takes away from the male and females marriage don't they say that it destrys the sanctity of the marriage
0	I don't have a clue
1	people think that like it it takes away from like the union that's marriage like it takes away from the gay being married like I don't know that's just my opinion
0	I I don't know either
1	some people think like it takes it makes it less of meaningful if gays can also get married or a male and a female it maes it less meaningful
0	I can't see that
1	yeah I don't either I don't think it makes sense either like if you're married and you see gay people getting married their lik eoh that destroys what we have
0	makes sense
0	for them
1	yea $ it doesn't I knowbut I don't it doesn't make sense anyway
0	I guess maybe it's an argument that um it can't produce some children I I can sort of see that because um [...] because he saw [...] baby that's mean I guess I could see that how it could potentially harm the psychy of children but it's just something that should be taught that it's okay
1	yeah I think that it's kind of silly to say that because your job as a parent is to teach your kids so that's something else you have to teach them to teach the that yeah males can get married to males females can get married to females and vice versa
