1	well I personally think that um from everything I've seen especially here in the valley that there are is a lot of drugs around around here so I feel like marijuana shouldn't be legalized because it's a gateway drug I feel like that if we legalize it that um it'll just lead to othe things like once everyone starts using marijuan then they don't feel like it'll be strong enough it wont give them that thrill of a keeping it underhand like they don't have to hide it anymore so there they're gonna I feel like the reason people smoke marijuana is because it gives them the thrill of trying to hide it from other from like the law so once it's legalized people are gonna be like well we can smoke it where ever we want we don't we don't like this anymore so they're gonna vote for the next new thing and the next new thing and it's always gonna keep moving on how do you feel about it?
0	yeah I I completely agree with you yeah I think that marmarijuana shouldn't be legalized it's the same aspect because it is a gateway drug so it's like I feel like the same the like people right now use becasue it's like um it's kind of deviant so it's like you would like you know you wanna like oh you're doing something behind the police but like if it's legalized the like they might branch out to stronger drugs maybe um something more potent that you know could cause more harm or something also I think that um if like if it's legalized like um you'll be able to put like taxes on it but it's like I think that would have like nega um like a negative effect in the sense of um that like right now I think well I don't know I'm sorry but um yeah I think that we shouldn't like we shouldnt legalize it mar marijuana
1	um also another thing that i along the lines of that would be that a lot people who don't do marijuana for the same thing like they wanna try it but they they don't do it because it's illegal but if we give them the concept that oh it's legal now they're gonna be like well there's nothing wrong with it I can just go and buy it so there's nothing wrong with it and then they just start using it and what even though I've a from what I've heard is that it isn't addictive I still think that um people are gonna be smoking it and using it because it's there it's a shomething that they can use to they can use and they can get a probably in stores just go to the store and get it and a just like anything else it is a drug it's not gonna change the fact that because it's legal it's not a drug it's gonna be like taking a cold medicine like even though it's you're taking it a legaly it's still bad for you like if you take itin the wrong circumstances um so if you use it to just get high and feel like you're you can get high and that you're gonna get so used to that feeling that you're gonna wanna keep taking it and wanna keep taking it and after a while your body is gonna start getting used to that um just like anything else your body gets used to you're gonna start feeling that you wouldn't want something stronger and marijuana is just not gonna be fufilling anymore
0	yeah I also think like um like by legalizing marijuana like I feel like um we'll be able to make like the side of being able to make more profit off it by tax by givving taxes but then like that's I feel like that's that's kind of like bad because it's like okay we're gonna make profit off of like damaging youths like youths' health or like peoples' health so it's like also I think like that shouldn't be something like maybe like opposing argument could be like oh we if we give mar like if we make marijuana legalized the we'll be able to tax and make money so it's like you know like with alcohol and stuff like that but it's like why would we wanna make money off something like we never caused like you know damage to people so it's like I also think that's whywe shouldn't like legalize marijuana
1	um most definitely um one of the things also that I like to use as a like as an example would be tabacco a lot of people used tobacco not knowing what the uh like the outcome was gonna be and now we're finding out that we have cancer and stuff like that and uh I feel like we've got it to and extent where there haven't been experiments on marijuana but the whole like the as a as it being legal and being used by a whole nation um we haven't really been able to see the outcomes of it so the problem might be that something might come up and we might not be we might not be able to prevent something like cancer or something might be worse than that so by legalizing it we might be just leading into another like another state of cancer and then yeah and you know
0	that's true
1	um well like it all likeI just I don't feel like it should be legalized because of that because even now like alot of kids if it a lot of the reason that it a lot of kids don;t use it is because it isn't available to them a lot of kids will wanna try it especially younger kids now that um generations start like they're evolving and jutst with everything in social media I remember just growing up not like I feel like were kids growing up in a different world now that everythign has evolved like things that I was doing in middle school kids are doning like elementary school and the same thing in kids in middle school are doing things that kids would do in highschool and I think it's evolving in that way where um if kids start using marijuana so early because it's available to them because it's legal that they're gonna start getting damaged at a younger age because their body won't be prepared to somehow adapt to that quicker than uh like a stronger body would so I think if that that's gonna be a big problem that if you make it legal even if it's just for eighteen and older like one like kids I see kids at in middle school and in highschool that aren't eighteen smoking cigarettes because they're available at stores and you know you go to a clerk and you're like alright well can I get that and they'll be like well can I see your ID well I don't have an ID but I can give you another ten dollars you know and they give them cigarettes and it's gonna be the same thing with marijuana if you're like oh I'm not eighteen but I can give you some extra money it's gonna be the same thing there's a reason why they put that age limit because your bodies aren't aren't prepared to take that much
0	elementary school
0	yeah you don't know the damage that it can cause yeah
1	yeah yeah
1	and I think that's gonna be one of the problems that we're gonna be facing if we legalize marijuana that a lot of people are gonna a lot of younger kids are gonna wanna start using it and it's gonna cause a problem to their bodies
0	yea it probably would cause more damage than like than benefit like from legalizing marijuana so it's like that's whay I was like I oppose it as well that's like yeah we're like like like yeah with liek cigarettes and stuff like that and like the kids can get it like easily you know some stores don't even ask the age so it's like you know they're like it's just because it's like very like easy to access them so like they just use it so it'd be like the same hting with marijuana
1	and I think it's just it's a [...] drug like if people a like if people are gonna use it they're not really thinking about the outcome of it like there just using it because of what they heard and what and so they start actually using it they're gonna realize what actually and does to them they're gonna not I don't feel like it's addicting but I feel like it's gonna be something that's they're they're gonna get so used to that they're they're not gonna be able to live without like they're gonna be like well I'm gonna feel high you know so let me feel high and then after a while your body is gonna get used to it so much that you're gonna want something else um something else and lie you know it has been used as a gateway drug and it's just gonna lead to bigger problem that's that's what I think
0	yeah I agree yeah I thinkit will just like lead to bigger problems just because like it is the gateway drug you know like if like if marijuana is legalized than what's gonna be the next thing like there like there that people are using instead of like marijuana like I feel like marijuana is used so much because like it is like illegal like that's the most I think it's like the most abused drug like
