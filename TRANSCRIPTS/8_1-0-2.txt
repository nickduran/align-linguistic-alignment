0	what what did you say?
1	oh I would legalize it
0	oh you would legalize it? oh I said no but. I do not know it could go both ways though. like why do you think it should be?
1	I think we can just legalize it to have for the government to tax on it. and that way they can like create money.
0	I get you.
0	I I said no because like. you could start. like people get more access to it you know? like if like people already have access to it but there is some people out there that like they want to do it but it is illegal so that that keeps them from doing it. but when you legalize it you everyone gonna start drink like everyone drinks so like that and then
1	well I compared it to drinking because I mean um I mean obviously it is intoxicating drinking and marijuana but they sell alcohol. and then I just believe like marijuana is a much more natural way I guess. and then like there is a lot of crimes that goes on because of drugs. so maybe by legalizing they will not have to be fighting over like marijuana and drug dealing and all that. because I am pretty sure no one drug deals with alcohol so
0	well true too. I think like mm if you have alcohol like people get they will have access to it but uh. weed like marijuana when you when you legalize it people someone else will buy it for you you know? and like and it has like a lot of problems with it. health problems and stuff like that and then. but it could go both ways like if if you wanna. my answer is like in the middle my answer is in the middle. I do not know what to say. um. like if you if it should not be legal if it if you do not legalize it it is still going to be like popular among uh kids but when you legalize it they are going to have more access to it and just like alcohol they are going to binge on it like the the small kids or whatever and you have more like more like more health problems with that way too and um do you have anything to say?
1	um well by legalizing marijuana um not only will like I believe that the crime rates will like lower down but um. I am pretty sure like the government can somehow like limit the supply um sold to a specific people. like there has to be like regulations and um they should keep like a record of how much you take out and who it is taking out to.
0	you think when it is legalized they are still going to sell it illegally?
1	like under the table like people still sell it?
0	yeah like on the streets or something.
1	I am pretty sure a possibility I mean they do that with alcohol people like buy like they will yeah do like here here is some money go get me some alcohol. it is like it is gonna happen either way but at the same time by doing this you will be the government will be getting some money back and I am pretty sure what they want.
0	for their friends and stuff
0	yeah true too. do you think the crime rate is gonna drop?
1	yeah I think so. not like dramatically but like at least like
0	because I think like there is still gonna yeah because there is like still gonna be people that selling under the table. and there is still gonna be like drug wars over that maybe too.
0	and plus like is the government gonna regulate where it is made at? they will have to. and you think you think there should be like an age limit on it? like eighteen or twenty one?
1	of course yeah there has to be an age limit and
0	I think like even if you
1	it probably could be like the same age as twenty one
0	twenty one. why you think it is twenty one?
1	because eighteen is too young like. or maybe twenty five because I think like when the brain like stops developing so it is just like maybe after that we can
0	eighteen so because like
0	yeah because like there is there is countries like age limit is set like to the country where like some are sixteen some are eighteen I do not think like age limit is like a proper um accurate amount like accurate
1	the age? you do not think it
0	yeah like the age is not really accurate to describe like when a person should be legal you know? like it is not saying like oh you turned eighteen like oh now you are legal now your brain is all fixed up and like. so but
1	k. now you are legal.
1	what age would you say?
0	I do not think it should be legal all I wanna say. yeah but yeah and then. it could bring in tax revenue though. but we have to look at how much revenue is brought by alcohol how much it would make a difference. and. how many more minutes? three more? alright um.
1	alright um. it is
0	you strongly agree with it?
1	I am like somewhat close to no. like there is a reason it has it is pros and its cons but like however so does alcohol like I am comparing it because they are both like intoxicating so I just
0	well I kinda get what you are saying too of like like if you take medication it is legalized you know but they will still kill you. like if you pop like ten advil it will be it will be like the last headache.
0	you then no like
1	why I was saying I guess marijuana is like a more natural way. because I personally do not really like taking medicines so it is just like. Just wait it out.
0	well we could regulate who gets it or not you know?
1	why I was saying like they regulate
0	like there is prescriptions in the drug store like but but then again
1	there has to be like a certain record and then
0	but then again like the cough medicines or whatever like people they like uh they get on them like to get high and stuff. they still get find the ways to get it you know? like I know people that like they get the cough medicine or whatever without the doctor's prescription. it is they get it on the street. I think the same way it is gonna be like with marijuana too.
1	yeah but I mean we can not stop all the drug dealing. I mean we can limit it but we are not gonna stop it completely. so like no matter what there is gonna be drug dealing
0	I think the access to
1	so might as well just like tax on it.
0	yeah the access is gonna be the same still. and I do not know is is medicine taxed?
1	I am pretty sure. huh?
0	is medication taxed?
1	I am not sure.
0	um well yeah and then like you will have to see if the insurance companies will cover the legal amounts of marijuana and how much they they are willing to do yeah?
0	uh. and
