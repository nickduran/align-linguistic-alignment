0	okay do you want to go first?
1	uh sure um okay so I think that gay and lesbian marriage is okay I don't think there's any problem with it um I think that if two people love each other like want to be committed to each other then they shouldn't have any kind of barrier just because of like their sex
0	yeah um I agree just because I think that something that you cannot control right uh it's not so much so like okay just because person say I'm a girl I cannot really control who I like that's just how a person is I feel like
1	yeah it's
1	that's how they're like it's innate they're born with it I don't think it's a choice I feel like a lot of people think that but I don't think it is
0	yeah and I also think that things do change so people usually argue that like okay we should follow the traditional marriage um how the church have it um the more religious side of the of it I feel like or um how they think might impact other people um but the same time like things do change like we have changed a lot of things from the past and if you look at a normal couple I guess like a girl and a guy um that's doesn't how how they're marriage is doesn't really um impact another person um and for me I feel like a woman and man can marry and they could be arguing every day and that can affect another like the society I guess or a next door neighbor so it wouldn't make sense to argue okay well there's two gay men or gay or lesbians married together they will impact the society
1	society yeah and I think I could see um like other sides about um yeah if it's a religious thing but I feel like a lot of couples today they're like heterosexual couples like they don't really go with um the religious side like they'll have weddings at parks and they'll have priests that like they know and like you know people can like get their own priest license now and I feel like marriage is become a lot less religious than it used to be and so for the idea that it physically says in the bible that it has to be man and a woman like considering the fact that most men and women that um like that are like protestant or um even like agnostic or they they still get married so I mean shouldn't it be I mean if your not like men and women have to be like the uh same sex marriage can't happen then you should also say that like people who aren't religious can't get married either because that's like going against the whole idea of it you know
0	right so it's more like I think in that sense it's more like okay we're picking like choosing and picking which ones we want to say it's okay and then specific things we're not okay with and then that's not really fair I guess um just because different people have different standards of what is okay so I
1	and I feel like it's also a lot of the people who are super against it are older and I feel like this generation like if you ask us questions in like twenty years like it would be like a lot different response because I feel like people will be like now age are a lot more accepting of like differences in people and stuff like that I mean like with leasbians and gay couples
0	yeah because I think that change is more towards equality and everyone has the rights all that good stuff and okay so we kind of like got the same page and then we're suppose to or coming up with argument points for the other team right?
1	yeah um
1	so basically I feel like the main arguement I against it is just because in the isn't it like just in the bible that it say that marriage is between a man and woman and so people are angry about that and it's like yeah they're trying to keep it like a sacred thing it that what the main
0	um I mean I'm not really religious so I don't really know
1	yeah see I'm not religious either but I want to get married you know that kind of thing but um but then also like people that all different religions get married and so why is it just looking at one religion'd like book and what one religion says versus all of them you know I mean but I also feel like America um
0	well yeah
0	we're more open minded
1	yeah um but also like we don't have um uh like we don't have a yeah a specific religion because like everybody I mean there is there is a specific language now there used to not be a in the past few years that like offically credited as english but we don't have an official religion but then if you say like the pledge of allegance it says like under god and so like it implies all that kind of stuff so like I don't know I feel like we shouldn't care so much about religion in our laws you know because like I mean it's one thing to not believe in it but to make it a law kind of goes against
0	so maybe our our part of our counter argument point might be that making people to certain standard because feel like your uh your suggesting that like they might argue okay well we're a diverse society so why is it that we're pin pointing a specific relgion to enforce that arguement right?
1	yeah and I guess I feel like I talk I'm trying to argue religion a lot but um seperation from church and state is like one big thing in our country um because I feel like it is like based off people who are like super conservative kind of like religious and like you I mean the country is based off the seperation of those two and you can't you can't just make a law that like um singles out certain people just because of like a certain belief yeah just a belief
0	ha ha
0	a difference
0	yeah and then I do agree like it's more I feel like usually people who disagree with this like their mind set is more tradtional they think of like the traditional sense of what is suppose to happen and so it'd be like another point besides religion maybe we can just or like keeping people from a certain standard and making them do something um maybe we could argue that like it's not right to make people do certain things even in other aspects so like why is it okay when it comes to their personal life like I can't tell you who you can't date or who you can date so why is it okay for those people just because their different
1	yeah I agree and like if it's tradition like if it's tradition I mean it's true that things change and um like even going back to like um segration like between people and like races and stuff I mean it was once a law and then we realized that it was wrong and it was taken away and then if you look at California with uh marriage uh like gay marriage it was a law and it was fought so hard like took it away right you can get married like gay and lesbian people can get married in California now I'm pretty sure it was like revoked but
0	um I think so I think so I think so
0	that was like a few years ago right?
1	it was
1	um when the when the law first got put into place yeah so I mean we're fighting it now so um like I feel like like it just shows nothing is set in stone you should be able to be like aggressive and change and like to make new ideas and like the newer generation are like coming up with more acceptance like you know
0	yeah I agree and just because it's how society improves you can't just always stick with the old thing I mean like sure there are perks and like positives and about the old things because they worked in the past but there's also reasons why there is a need to change um because somethings missing or is not good enough so
