0	okay what do you think about that?
1	uh well I feel like the death penalty it is uh it like it is extreme and like I do not like it but it should be used in certain cases. that is how I feel.
0	like certain cases what do you mean?
1	like um well like murder that kind of stuff. what about so you are against it? I can guess right?
0	uh # uh yes because I think like everybody deserves a second chance so and then I also do not believe that like the legal system can like really determine a person is a murderer or not. so yeah.
1	yeah like i have also heard stories about people who are on death row and they were are executed and then after the fact they found out they were innocent. and I feel like for those situations like if it is not clear like if they do not have enough DNA evidence or it is all circumstancial and that then they probably should not be put on the death sentence probably like life sentence at least. like
0	like but the cases were actually they went through a lot of um how to say it? like they actually um investigate investigate did a lot and then they actually got a lot of evidence to like put the person like in death penalty. so um so I do not know like because like for me I was thinking um I would rather um save one like save a person instead of like make any mistake.
1	make a mistake okay uh clarify on that? like oh you mean make sure
0	yeah actually I would I would rather like put the person in life penalty instead of like death penalty. because you can not have it if you like like if the person die so you have nothing to kind of help it. if you like later on you prove that person is actually an innocent
1	okay. um yeah as I said like and then the waiting period because they spend several years on death row before the put it you know execute them. so as I said I think extreme cases um and then um if there is sufficient evidence to back them up and then like for some people like um when I was in middle school or something there was a gang member that was going to be executed and he showed no remorse for killing the people that he did and he was executed. but yeah so it is yeah I mean there was this there was evidence to back them up. like there was video there was there was evidence the gun was registered to him so it was it was backed up but I understand if um yeah so I understand where you are coming from. if the person was innocent and there was nothing to back it up I do not think he should be executed. yeah.
0	but um like are you looking at the evidence like does sufficient evidence only or are you looking at the person? if the person regret or not? like or are they combined?
1	I think it should be combined with evidence and
0	and just see if the person is
1	yeah and I mean if like they could be given a pardon I feel if they show regret that they have grown and that they have used their experience to help educate the or their influence to help educate the you know the community because there has been there has been people that are on death row that you that join programs that tell people you know do not do drugs do not do gangs that kind of stuff and and they did that they wrote books you know talking about their experience and it is basically telling the public about their exerience and how they kind of regretted it and they have made an effort to say to the victims families that they are wrong and they are asking for forgiveness or they apologize so for those cases I feel they should be pardoned and now life sentence or that kind of stuff
0	but um I actually want to ask you a question. why do you think um like life penalty is not enough?
1	is not enough. it is
0	like for those people you mentioned?
1	for those people like there are some crimes I feel should have a high penalty. it is kind of to it is to make sure people do not do them. like if like if um you know if you were kids you knew you know you knew not to hit your siblings or to not be mean on the playground because if you did that would be time out right? and that would be kind of an incentive not to do it is because you would be penalized and it is you know it is kind of like if it is very serious business to execute someone I feel. and if that is the penalty then everyone knows that this is you know murdering somebody or committing this crime that deserves this penalty should not be done you know. that is what I am thinking.
0	but do you think like when a murderer like killed a person would they think about the penalty?
1	do they think about the penalty? sometimes it is in the heat of the moment and you know and they do not think about it and sometimes they do and they juust do not care. and sometimes yeah.
0	so you are saying that like actually the death penalty is used to scare the public or to scare like the person who is about to commit crime or
1	it is you know it is probably like you know it is like educating the community. it is holding them to these standards and then the individuals it is you know you they should know it and if they forget about it then yeah it is I mean and then if they remember later well it is like as I said in the heat of the moment like it could be due to rage or something and they will realize it is a mistake or they did not mean to but the fact of the matter being is that they did it. if they show remorse then they should be you know they should still be punished but it should not be to such an extreme.
0	okay so so like um let me clarify what you just said so you are saying that uh the death penalty is used to like can not like punish
