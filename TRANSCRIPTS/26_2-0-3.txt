0	What do you think about same sex marriage?
1	um I don't know
0	um gay marriage um I approve of it just because um marriage is between to people in love gender doesn't really matter I think right now gender is as conflicting as race was 50 years ago so I think it's time people understand that it doesn't really matter as long as two people love each other they should be allowed to get married and the biggest concern against that is it goes against the bible but say your not say you don't believe in jesus your not christian or whatever god shouldn't dictate love like another being the way another being feels about another being dictates love
1	okay um well I think that um everybody has the right to be with who they want to be with but I think marriage is a holy thing and I think that that is between two people and god and I think that um I don't know I just everyone has their own rights and everyone should be allowed to be with who they want to be with I just don't think it should be called marriage because that's something that's something religious ion my views so
0	I think like you said it's religious in your views part of our government is the freedom of religion so just because your not christian and you don't follow god doesn't mean you shouldn't be allowed to be married especially in this country like marriage is between two people generally physically it's between two people it's apparent between two people in love and whether they're religious or not they you include god like you said it's a connection between two people and god but for people you don't believe in god you shouldn't withold the ability to get married that's not right because these two people like if they feel that they are like partners and they feel like they should be married and they're in love then they're religious beliefs shouldn't have dictation of whether or not they should get married.
1	yeah um well I think that um like you said if it's religious that um there's a difference between the religious marriage that is like hold in church and you have a pastor marry you and that and then legally being bound together the legal marriage I think is different from a holy marriage
0	that's true but then again in this day and age how are you going to get what you consider marriage if people oppose it so no matter what people oppose it and they are from the side that are opposing it how are you going to allow two people to even get married
1	I think it would be well legally married um I think um a legal document is different saying like by the state you are married inside by god
0	so then you don't oppose gay or lesbian marriage you just oppose having
1	I oppose it in the church I think that I think it's different between two people getting married and having like a judge marry them or you know someone ordained by um the state
0	but why does it why does it matter if you in a church or not if you do want to be married in a church that means you are a christian but if your gay and you get married in a church and you are a christian and you believe in like god or jesus or whatever then you also believe that god love everyone so why are you not allowed to be a christian and get married
1	I think um well in the bible it's a sin so I think it it goes against god if your standing in a church and your being or being or your getting married in front of god if your sinning in front of him right then
0	I don't know to much about religion so
0	people will get married and their different religions
1	not just christians
0	so what's the difference between that if they if two people get married in a church one's christian and one isn't so clearly one doesn't believe in god or jesus which ultimately they're not a follower so what's the difference like can that religion be considered that opposing religion be the same as someone being gay
1	okay well um in christianity um we're taught that we need to spread the word of jesus christ and I think that if you are that involved with a christian and that person really is a devote christian then your going to know that your life is going to be involved with jesus and that this person is trying to spread christianity
0	so just because your gay doesn't been you can spread christianity?
1	I'm not saying that I'm saying that there's that's a sin I don't I don't know how to describe it it's I don't know it's um it's just it's something that is between you and god and I think that um yes god forgives for your sins and he loves you anyways but again that's between you and god
0	So between an individual and god if a gay man was to want to get married and it was between him and god so why is that allow other people to impede and judge and tell the other person that they can't be married if the relationship is strictly between him and god
1	I don't know it's between him and god
0	So then again like you said it's between him and god so two christian gay males or females want to get married what gives you the right to say that they can't if the relationship like you just said forbatem is between them and god
1	but if their christians then they know that in jesus's eyes that that is a sin
0	but you can't change who you are
1	I'm not saying that they have to
0	so your going to withold the right of marriage to be right
1	and to I said that they have that right
0	but it's like it's like uh during like the civil rights where we're seperate but equal which in time prove was incorrect
1	I'm saying that they have that right as citizens
0	to get married right that's what your saying, extactly which is seperate but equal because your still getting married but it's seperate between people that feel, and it's still the way you feelthe religious views that you have seperates you so if your a christian and you want to get married to another male or female person of the same sex why should it be seperate between church and the state
1	to get married but not wholly matrimony
1	well the church is not a part of the state
1	because church and state is seperate
0	yeah I understand that but like I forgot about some better words
0	you said that your fine with marriage but you don't believe it belongs gay marriage but you don't think it belongs in church which is segregating gay people to be married by a document in a courthouse right? you don't think that's unjust that your seperating them from their religion if they
