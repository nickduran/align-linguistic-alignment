1	I'm for
0	I was for too
1	Okay why do you say for
0	I said that um you can love whoever you want as long as you don't harm anyone so it isn't a matter or gay lesbian or anything so as long as you're not hurting anyone around you it doesn't really matter and it doesn't affect you anyway so it's like whoever that person is
1	Cause yeah because you're going to be living with that person so yeah if you don't um you know hurt anyone else it's your own business and I think it's also like having yeah um being able to marry anybody is like kind of like a basic human rights because you know how before like even they have the like jim crow law yeah even like white and black you can't even marry. And it's just like you're still a human being and we're not like different species or anything so I think yeah it's like
0	hm hm*
0	hm hm*
0	It's whatever makes you happy
1	What makes you happy and then everybody has the rights to you know and we're living in America so you have to think about you know uh the rights and just whoever you love marry them rich or poor girl or boy
0	Yeah it's more of like 30 years ago was the black and white thing so it wasn't that far ago we can change it
1	and it's also about like happiness you know cause you can't uh live up to other people's expectations and you can't like hide what you have like you know your true self forever so yeah I think it's well it's good for marrying but if I were to argue with someone who's opposing it um
0	It's like if anything you're not the one marrying they are so deal with it $
1	But then they will be like um you know for I think if anyone would be opposed to it it would be somebody who is like religiously like yeah strong I mean I'm a christian but like uh you know it says in the bible like how you should not you know lay down with the same men or whatever same woman so whatever so I mean in that case I guess like it would be hard for anybody who's believing in the bible but when we live realistically in the world you know
0	Yeah time changes like 34,000 years
1	And we can't take literally everything in the past yeah so I don't agree with $
0	yeah honestly um
1	So what else should we say if they say like uh
0	some people say that it's not right its kind of just yeah well besides religious they say that it's not the
1	God doesn't like it
1	Appropriate yeah
1	Appropriate no?
1	Or they might be like disgusted by it I don't know but yeah I think anybody should be able to marry who they want to marry $
0	Like if you want to eat pizza eat pizza you know? Like you shouldn't be forcing someone to (give up their right)
1	Yeah it's human rights $ we all have the rights to like pursue happiness $ yeah just
0	That's just (?)*
0	Our fathers faught for this
1	Yeah mainly because you love somebody so I think as long as it makes you happy it's your own business your decision and if something happens don't come back to me $ and tell me that
0	Yeah it's your own choice no one is forcing you to
1	And besides there would be less population in the world $
0	Yes we're overpopulated
1	Except that maybe in a country there might be more like disease like I don't know
0	Well if you're protected are we all set or $
1	Yeah kind of I mean yeah like we're saying why
0	Yeah well if you're protected and knowledgable about it
0	(Kind of double minded)
1	And not to be yeah stuck in traditional life and I mean later on like generations and generations like you know we have to make our own choice for our own generation what works best for our generation I mean before that you know with generations before us it's like so different
0	Yeah you should always be open minder cause you never know what's going to happen in the future so like they never thought black and white could get married so why not now gay and lesbian?
0	uh $
1	yeah so
1	I don't know what else to talk $
0	Yeah and the thing about the bible you can contradict it
0	that traditional people um
1	I don't know what else yeah marriage for love
0	Yeah well I think some gay people are even happier than straight couples cause there are less divorces to take down than straight people and stuff
1	I never really read about the divorces
0	Yeah so maybe they're happier they know what they're talking about
1	They're looking more from the inside than stability between man and woman and like they don't you know like some people marry because you know they expect to have a family because
0	yeah they understand each other more*
0	aw some gay people can adopt so
1	Yeah but like for I guess like generally that's why people marry image and like family's expectations and some people don't even marry all their life so
0	whole image*
0	and then#
0	done with that too (?) $
1	But yeah if you want to get married it's okay you can be together and so
0	And if you just live together you don't have have to get married
1	yeah i mean that's the same way with men and women too right
0	yeah I feel like just living together
1	So I don't know yeah
0	especially for dicorce
1	what else is there to talk about?
0	okay some people think if gay people marry their kids would be weird from them? I don't think so i think gay couples are just as normal
1	yeah normal and just people and just you know just a little bit different from the normal situation where like you have a mom and dad yeah
0	yeah they're just more open minded I think
1	I think taking care of kids would probably be the same or even better
0	yeah cause the kids they want so
1	and the kids will be more open minded and will pass on their generations so people won't be as prejudiced and judging or discriminating
1	it's kind of better for people in the future
