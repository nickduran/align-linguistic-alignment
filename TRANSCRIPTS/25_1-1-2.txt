1	Do we begin? Oh so what do you say on uh legalization of marijuana?
0	I say no
1	Why is that?
0	Why is that?
0	It's because people don't seem like they're able to function when they are on marijuana like they are smoking pot like they just keep smoking smoking and they are like they are just way out of it. They are they get hungry you know have their munchies and so they are you know enjoying their food packing it in And then they pass out! How is that benificial? And people try to function like that people try to drive vehicles people try to run errands like that is not good what if what if they like just get really sleepy at the wheel And they like do something wrong
1	that is so true
1	Okay I say yes because people out there they are going to do it anyways like I I think that if it was legalized like since it is legal less people would do it
0	Oh so you are saying since it is not legal more people are going to.
1	If it is Because like I do not know I guess it takes the fun of it away I guess. It is like I don't know like I talked about this with someone before and that is what they told me but um other than that people are still going to do it though like but I see your say like the function of car driving and stuff that is true but
0	It is not just that though its like things on a on a whole other level the people that I have seen that um actally do anything like smoke marijuana they say that if it were legal if it was legalized they would be smoking all day every day. Like all day every day so how are they going to go to class how are they going to go to work how are they going to support themselves? They are just going to get into more trouble. But they will find more trouble most of them when they do smoke do not recall half of the events that occured. So I am like haha ok um you know they some of them really do not and they are like oh I really did that? I was like yea you were not drunk you were stoned. And I mean not all of them do that but I I see quite a few
1	*Yes. Yes.
1	is true
1	I guess it is kind of like okay nevermind that is going onto another topic I was going to start talking about alcohol now but um So what makes you say that people are going to smoke all day? Because because they want to do that?
0	Well because ok if it were legalized it would be easier for them to get different types of weed. It would be easier for them to to experiment more and they would be instead of wanting to do more productive things they would be busy with um getting high. And so then they are like oh it is a new blend I am going to try it or oh this sounds really cool I am going to go do this. It is like oh I have homework oh I have a job it is okay I am just going to go smoke and then I am going to go do it. And then it does not get done. They are just they are just there vegetating away
1	is that is true
1	is so true
1	I do not know what else to add to this. But you are your point is very strong I can see where you are coming from cause like I was debating on that question too. I was like I do not know
0	I mean there are not there are not like very many studies that prove this being very harmful but you can still see the side effects. Like I mean if people want to do it they are going to do it. But legalizing it will just be like oh it is okay to do that Like it is our right if you would just want to like you know liked
1	Yeah I guess it depends on the person too because like because there is like since there are still going to be people. like there is people that get high like all day also so it does not neccesarily mean that if it does get legalized that people are willing to going to people are going to want to do it like all day because people already do that
0	Well some not all. But the people that I know that do smoke um like they they are like oh man if it was legalized I would not even be here I would just I would be I am just like
1	is true
1	okay. I guess it depends see it depends on the person I guess. That is
0	It is not like one person. I have talked to quite a few people about this
1	They want to get high all day?
0	Pretty much. They they enjoy that feeling that and I am like what is what is and then it kind of like an addiction. And then and like I am not addicted to it and I am like yes you are. I mean you are always smoking it. I am pretty sure you are addicted and so yeah legalization could just add to that addiction. Like oh you want some? Go take them all.
1	people always tell me that too
1	But where are they going to like. Like if it does get legalized where are they going to dispense it at then? Or at in like medical clubs or something?
0	Well if it is legalized then it is like buying a pack of cigarettes. It would be like that. that is where it would be very easy to access. There might be an age limit but. I do not I do not know
1	okay yeah
1	I think like if it does get legalized and like dealers would have less money then. because they can not sell anymore And that would harm them too though
0	Or if you think about it it is if that gets legalized then the dealers are off from selling pot to selling harder drugs and they are going to be selling harder drugs to like everyone that they can find. and then if you also think if it is legalized um under aged people would be getting a lot like.
1	What do you mean underaged?
0	For example cigarettes
1	You have to be 18
0	like um you have to be 18 but people that are 18 always buy cigarettes for people that are younger.And so it will be easier
1	I have not seen that yea ok
0	I have seen quite young children smoking and it would be the same concept. They would be smoking weed and so like they are they are doing like they are doing this at such a young age
1	Oh wow it like no if you are saying like if they get set at like a legal age then these like adults would be buying it for younger kids? which is bad okay that makes but like thats still like possible now a days too
0	Yeah but if you think about it like now if people do smoke most the times it is in like in a social clique like it is a social thing. Like lots of people smoke weed together they are not going to be like trying to like give it to a I mean I am pretty sure it does happen like now and then like they will try to give it to someone younger but most the time they just do it with themselves like try to push harm onto other people
1	Unless like the kid wants some I guess I do not know. How many more minuets do we have? Because I ran out of ideas. And you convinced me pretty good. So do we go on and blabber about? Ok nevermind
0	about legalization and
0	So no it should not be legalized is what that pretty much means
1	So do you have any like cons against that though?
1	By like say you are you want to say yeah No like if you say yes do you have any argument on that?
0	Any arguments for.
1	Yes. No
0	There is one argument for yes
0	You can make money off of that. You can get make money off of all the people that
1	That would be for government spending though but like government already like screws us over
0	Exactly! But then that that
0	but then that would reduce our debt but like it
0	Like that could help the people. So for example like people as it is like they do not have money when they are older like social security is right now so that if it were legalized like that like that could like go to to to. So that is
1	That is That is the only like good affect on it though like yeah
0	If you think about it like how plenty of people like with lots of um with lots of issues and stuff
1	because like no like um
