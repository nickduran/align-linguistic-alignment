1	uh I think it should just be legalized
0	yeah I say no
1	You say no?
0	Yeah because uh my house mates do it and I do not know I just do not like the effect that
1	it has on them?
1	well I just think it would be I mean alcohol has bad effects to I mean it messes up with your brain in the long run too if you drink too much you get like --- syndroms and all that stuff so we might not know the long term effects of marijuana but the whole point for it to be legalized is just to get tax money out of it I do not think it it is someones choice if they want to smoke but also like smoking cigarettes is bad but people do it anyways so if you are going to do it you are going to do it either way might as well get some the government get something out of it so I do not know I just think it would be best in the long run and then and then like also the problem is that some people get marijuana and it is like mixed with other stuff and it is better they get the medical marijuana then get one that is mixed because that can just lead to even more problems if it is mixed with things that are not at all good for you so you know I just think it is a choice if you do not want to smoke marijuana you do not have to I mean you do not have to smoke a cigarette even though it is legal you do not have to drink at 21 just becauase it is legal so that is my opinion
0	Yeah I feel like uh because it is not federally accepted and it is only state wide accepted that uh the government like the FDA can not approve it until they do like full on research and that would take more like a lot of tax money that we do not have just to do it just so our generation can have fun you know
1	Yeah but I mean that is the way it was with alcohol alchol was illegal in the 1920's but it is not anymore and it took a while for people to know people still do not know it depends on the person too i mean alcohol can lead to really bad stuff if you drink it every time and you become an alcoholic but it is not illegal and it took a while to get there but you know I mean in the long run there is tax and then cigarettes there is like you know I think a new law is going to be passed that it is going to be a dollar on every tax for a cigarette I do not know if it passed but it it is helping in the long run when it comes to tax money and if you want to do these things that are potentially bad for you people are going to do it anyways like in the 1920's everyone drank alcohol even though it was illegal people did it in their back yards and outside even though they knew it was bad so I am just saying people are going to do it weather it is leagalized or not and the penalty for people to go to jail because they have marijuana in their car I do not want to pay tax money just because you had marijuana in your car and you go to prison for I do not know how many years because I just think that is I would rather have someone who killed someone in prison and pay for that then not have someone who just smoked a lot of pot in their car that is just me
0	Well looking at it you see persepective I feel like uh because all of my room mates get like financial aid and then they spend their money on spend my money on buying all that stuff and it is like they are not doing so well in school because they are doing that and it is like oh I I guess like here is free money go ahead and do it that is where i say no because I feel
1	they spend their money on ha
1	but that is individually because when my brother went to medical school he went to Cornell and he knew people that smoked pot and they are having high end jobs now with 6 figures but they smoked pot so it is just individually who you know some people who smoke pot do not do well in school and then there is other people who are brilliant and they smoke pot and I am just like how is it that you have straight As and you smoke pot every day? It pisses me off because I do not smoke pot and then they are getting grades but you know I think it is individually you know how it effects you and stuff like that
1	uh hm I am trying to think would you try it if it was legalized?
0	Uh I guess if I had nothing much to do like studying but uh other than that no like
1	no? have you ever tried a cigarette?
1	Do you drink? or are you 21?
0	Yeah I'm 21
1	Oh okay uh uh I do not know if I would try it if it were legalized just becaue I know the bad stuff part of it but I do not know people do hookah though hookah supposedly people think hookah is safe
1	It is not but people think so because they are just smoking water with some I do not know mint or whatever the choose but I do not know I think in the long run it will just benifit people and people do it anyways so uh yeah I do not know uh
0	well do you like it if you were walking down like up the hill or whatever and people were just like
1	no I hate no because I mean there is already rules for cigarettes for that because my mom she can not be around smokers she has to like walk around them or like go to the other side if there is like smokers around so I think you know just how there is areas for smoking there should be areas for smoking marijuana like I guess it could be in the same area or whatever but I think the law for that and I know that UCs are I do not know if this is just a rumor that UCs want to have a like a campus where there is no smoking allowed on campus like at all like what so ever like I mean I know we have smoking we have smoking areas like when I lived in the dorms we had an area and like my friend would get in trouble if she smoked anywhere near like mariposa or anything so I think that is better because there is people who do get like a bad reaction to it and my mom is one of them so you know there should still be those rules for marijuana at best because there is rules for smoking and then alcohol like in public unless you are in Vegas I know in Vegas you can but uh I do not know in Vegas if you can smoke outside actually I know you can drink outside I do not know if you can just smoke wherever you want I think you can because it is Vegas
0	Fair game anywhere
1	Yeah but I think it should be able for smoking marijuana it would apply the same for smoking cigarettes
0	how would you think of someone smoking and then going to drive
1	Well no you can not do that that is why it is called driving under the influence it is not called driving under drinking it is under whatever influence that you are on you can not even drive if you have I know that you can not drive when you have Nyquil because that effects your it impares your judgement or whatever it impares your driving skills so I think the same rules would apply for marijuana I just know that if you get caught though I think it is worse because it is illegal if you are smoking pot so I do not know I think the same rules should apply
