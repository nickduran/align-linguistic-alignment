0	So healthcare
1	Did we start?
1	Oh okay um I do believe we should have universal healthcare cool um I guess I believe that probably cause of my experience with it uh my family doesn't have healthcare supplied by their jobs so it's very expensive for them to actually have healthcare and uh my brother's had a lot of medical issues like he's like broken a lot of bones so he can't actually get healthcare because of his um like history of medical issues so it's hard for him. Yeah so its like my personal experience why I think we should have universal healthcare um yeah
0	*That's crazy
0	I think we should too because my mom doesn't work, and then we get like the government healthcare I guess you can call it medical all that good stuff and yeah I just think everybody should have free healthcare because there are a lot of homeless people too and they have like mental issues and they don't get the help they need yeah.
1	Uh huh
1	Yeah I think um examples of it are like in Canada and Europe and I just think they're very successful with it. Yeah it's like your tax money actually goes towards things that you um. It's high taxes but at least you know your taxes are going towards something that you care about and um I guess like it actually benefits your life. It benefits everybody yeah its much more of an equal type of system though which is like not really what America's about right now it seems like but uh it helps the like you know overall amount of people which is much better since there's so many people out there um
0	Oh Canada perfect $*
0	#Live with taxes high
0	It benefits everybody thats cool*
0	So just Canada and where else?
1	I like I don't know the specific countries but I know over in Europe they have
0	Wait isn't it near France or somewhere?
1	uh i'm not sure
0	Megan had us watch a video about it $ oh
1	Oh nice $ um I just I don't know it just seems really unequal if you um do not have healthcare and you say you're like impoverished that you cannot go and get medical health I think that's just like really messed up.
0	And people are just left on the streets to just I don't know wither away without the healthcare that they need. And when Megan showed us the video there's like this lady she was just left on the sidewalk in front of a hospital and like she couldn't even get the help she needed. It was crazy. Yeah I think if there was like more healthcare people wouldn't be on the streets as much. They'd probably be in like facilities getting help they need.
1	I think that's just like bad
1	I agree yeah um
0	But how much would tax rise? How much do you think?
1	That's definitely like the main issue is people are always concerned about their taxes um it's definitely be like an increase but
0	But don't you get your tax back? Like when you pay for taxes?
1	Yeah I mean pretty much yeah. If you're a person who doesn't get supplied healthcare then um you're not really paying any more. It's like not really any different. That amount that you're paying goes away and it goes into the amount you pay for taxes. So like I mean I don't know it just seems more worth it. And like medicare is cool and all but it's not as good of quality as um someone with like pretty good health insurance.
0	Yeah it's like uh hospitals can only help you through a certain ext a certain extent
1	Exactly yeah so it's like it helps but um uh yeah its just not as good as someone else who has a lot of money
0	About your brother so like was there like a limited amount of care he could get or?
1	Uh you just can't get health insurance if you have like um pre-existing issues they like look into your history and they make it a lot harder for you to get health insurance because uh if you have pre existing issues then that means that you're gonna be like using your health insurance a lot, and they don't really want to supply someone who actually wants to use it a lot I don't know its just well corrupt like that I mean that's my belief on it but yeah
0	that's crazy
0	Yeah free healthcare $
1	$ yeah i don't know $
1	^ How much longer $ keep going
1	um well why would you be opposed to it like let's play devil's advocate. I guess taxes are one thing but um. Yeah that's definitely true. $ That';s definitely true. I think like the biggest problem is rich people don't want to pay more taxes and they're really happy where they are and it's hard to move them from that position.
0	Rich people don't like to pay taxes. But they get it back $*
0	I think people like Oprah should have to pay for everything $
1	Yeah yeah I mean yeah that's pretty much. I don't know universal healthcare is sort of like this socialist idea and uh we brought it up earlier but its like this more equal idea everybody's a little more equal but it's hard to make someone or its hard to convince someone who's already on top of the food chain to be equal with everyone else. Yeah yeah so um it's kind of a hard transition its like money equals power its hard to take the power from them just to help others like yeah I don't know it's messed up.
0	Yeah because they feel like they're more inferior*
0	So why would you be against it?
1	Why would I be against it? Um yeah probably if I was like I probably wouldn't want to pay the taxes uh maybe like a conservative view would be like you didn't feel like people deserved it. They should work for it. They should have to like work for their earnings. They shouldn't just be given to them. Um so that's like more conservative view.
0	But there are people that work hard for it and still don't get like any benefits that they deserve.
1	Yeah that's true. Exactly. I think that's like the biggest issue.
0	Well my mom worked as a nurse for like a whole bunch of years are still had medical.
1	Yeah yeah um yeah conservatives seem to think that you have to work for what you get. But then it's like you are working for what you get you're like working and paying your taxes
0	I think when you become like a college student you have to have healthcare so
1	Yeah I paid two health insurances. I paid like um for two different health insurances. Cause you have to have the school's and then I have like my family one.
0	You have to have to schools? You can get a fee waiver for that can't you?
1	Are you yeah I don't know I don't actually know that but yeah $ I'll deal with that one myself but yeah I mean I don't know it's kind of messed up. You have to have one basically too be here so
0	*$ Oh no
0	That's why it should jsut be free. Because a whole bunch of students are going to college even if it's community college
1	Yeah. I know over in Canada it's not even an issue like they don't even talk about health insurance it's just like, yeah, like imagine how nice that would be that would be such a big relief like you don't have to worry about any of that.
0	They just go to the hospital. Okay I'll help you.*
0	Yeah. Oh my gosh okay wanna hear a story? Okay, so when I was like 13 my mom had this like massive heart attack and we were in the ER and then like nobody was in there it was just me and her. And there was this nurde sitting in the window and she was like okay fill out all these forms and then you can see a doctor. So my mom was like my chest hurts, and then she's just like sitting there breathing really hard, and then I'm like okay I'll fill out the papers for you. And so by the time I'm like trying to I didn't know anything about the ER so I'm like walking around the room trying to find a doctor. not knowing that you had to go behind the double doors, but like by the time I like came back over to my mom, she had like fell backwards, and like collapsed, and then the lady was finally like I'm gonna go get a doctor. Like oh so now you care. Yeah. Yeah. Cause she cared about whether she had the insurance or not. Like forget the papers if someone is having a massive heart attack just take them to see a doctor worry about that later.
1	Yeah thats crazy yeah that's a pretty good example of it that's rough*
1	Yeah it really brings up a big issue too how they make money a lot more valuable than your actual life.
