0	alright so what's your opinion about marijuana?
1	um i don't think it should be legalized
0	um why is that?
1	why because i don't know for example we have alcohol legalized so i feel it's already a problem by legalizing marijuana it's like another problem
0	yeah i feel the same way um you know how people are saying that marijuana doesn't pose any medical threat right but um we never get to find out in the long run because it's not legalized so uh it's impossible for a private companies and stuff to do tests on it so how do we know it's not uh it's not damaging to your health right especially for um legalizing tobacco which is pretty bad now that we found out because um we been legalizing it for a long time so we get to see exactly how it does in the long run yeah and um and people are saying by legalizing marijuana it can help with the economy as well because we get to tax it and then the FDA get to regulate it but um i don't think that's very effective because um you know how people are saying if uh people are already start using marijuana anyway so we if legalize it it won't change much buut then if you make it more available then people use it more right?
1	uh huh yeah
1	uh huh yeah
1	uh huh oh that's true yeah
1	uh huh
1	yeah but then again like it's uh the other way I see it it's like okay if we legalize marijuana then all the teenagers like won't have the [necessary] because oh it's legal we should do it so and for example alcohol we can't like um teenagers can't drink at age eighteen so that's why they do it because it's not legal for them but then again like if it was if marijuana was good it would be already legalized if it it wasn't like if marijuana had like positive affects or um good results or like help the humans it would already be legalized
0	yeah that's true yeah and i think especially because now marijuana is used for medical purposes so if we legalize it the effect won't be as effective anymore if you started using something much right you get immune to it so um later on we might not be able to use marijuana for medical purposes anymore because it won't work so ha ha yeah so for like the economic purposes i don't think it'd help to that point because right now if people are especially like the legal system they're cracking down people who bring in illegal marijuana so technically we are getting money for the economy right because they get like thousands of especialy hundreds of thousands dollars for illegalizing um marijuana or like illegal transport so yeah i don't think legalizing acutally or much more yeah
1	oh that's true uh huh
1	uh huh
1	yeah yeah
1	illegal marijuana
1	that's true haha yeah yeah
1	uh huh by legally yeah
1	uh huh
1	i don't think it's a good thing yeah i dont think it's like a good um thing for the country yeah
0	so we don't want to we'd rather be cautious now because then be sorry later just like alcohol and tobacco so
1	yeah yeah that's true
1	uh huh
1	well um
0	yeah i don't know i heard i heard people say that um um marijuana is not is not bad for you but i'm kind of concerned i don't know if it has any like effect on your mental
1	i'm pretty sure it has like negative affects like on the long run probably
0	does it give you mental retardation?
1	i don't know i heard like people like say okay it's good for you like well i mean it's like tobacco is worse and alcohol is worse but then i don't think it has um like it's not a good thing because if it was a good thing than like everyone would like it wouldn't be illegal i'm pretty sure
0	that's true yeah haha okay um yeah so so don't don't legalize marijuana and
1	i know that
1	[...] ha ha ha
1	isn't there like uh states that are legalized
0	yeah there are states that legalized marijuana already yeah so maybe we should study those states in order to see the long terms effect and then if it's effective then we can copy them but if it's not effective then we shouldn't follow
1	and then see uh huh
1	yeah but you don't think like like is there do they like a lot of them a lot of people use marijuana like for example is there a limited age too like alcohol?
0	uh i don't know if it's legalize then i'm pretty sure they're going to regulate to see what age you get to be able to use marijuana
1	in state
1	uh huh
1	but i still think like it's the same problem because as alcohol because like for example like teenagers like they want to do everything thats illegal for them so it'd be the same problem as alcohol uh huh
0	yeah that's true
0	because now we're saying that um for teenagers we don't want them to use um marijuana right but then if we legalize it just like alcohol and tobacco even if we put an age limit on it they're going to try to get it anyways so it it doesn't decrease the incentive to have it yeah
1	uh huh it's not going to be a big difference yeah
0	so i think we should just keep it right now for um medically purposes rather than expanding it for the public use
1	yeah yeah i think so i think that too um
0	yeah um
1	well um um i don't know what else um
0	so do you know the effect of marijuana for using it medical field
1	what do you mean like negative things?
0	no the fact that it why is it used in medical field?
1	the positives?
1	i'm not sure i um no honestly i don't know i gues it solves a lot of problems like yeah like um health problems
0	is it like temporarily reducing the symptoms
1	probably it is
0	i feel like it's
1	yeah because you get high so you like kind of forget about stuff i'm pretty sure like you can like rid the um like the pain i'm pretty sure it goes away so that's why they use it on medical field like um to cure or to relax
0	yeah because i know my cousin he has asthma and he
1	oh he uses it
0	he use the medical marijuana
1	oh like people with asthma use it?
0	i'm not sure if there's any other medical cases that use marijuana but yeah do i just think that using it too much will reduce the effect of it
1	medically um i don't know
1	uh huh
1	that's true because you get immune to it and it won't be effective anymore it won't be effective uh huh
0	yeah so i wonder if like doctors prescribe marijuana for personal purposes like illegally haha because they get to describe medicine right? so you don't know how how much they actually follow up with the so maybe they are ilegally
1	illegally that's true
1	and then they get paid
1	uh huh the rules uh huh
1	that's true
1	yeah because then how do people like get it like how from where yeah that why like how people have a lot um easy access to it if like you need a doctor's prescription
0	you need a doctor's prescription
0	yeah so if we illegalize at least it will kind of help to a certain extent
