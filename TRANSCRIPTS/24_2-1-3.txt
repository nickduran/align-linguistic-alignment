1	well um i've always been oppose to abortion i never really supported it um what do you think?
0	the same
1	okay so um some of the most like prominent things i thought i would say in like an argument is that um first of all i understand why people would want to exercise the right for abortion but i don't support it because um just thinking from my perspective if it was me like the baby you you have no idea who they could be they could grow up to be the next president or a doctor or lawyer and they could make a huge difference in life and if you you know chose to abort you don't know what could of happend
0	ha ha
0	yeah i feel it's murder which i don't agree with um the only instance that i would maybe be more okay with that or lenient on the view is in the case of rape just because i feel like you would just relive it every day for nine months and when you give birth and then i don't know maybe you look at your kid and think about what happend um in any other case i think you make the choice so that's what comes with your choice and if you really don't want the child you can put it up for adoption um
1	yeah and that's totally understandable to um when you have like the option to adopt they could get a great family and they could have like a really good life that never would have happend other wise they could go to school or have their own families so totally agree with that too
0	yeah um
0	are are you in the do you consider all stages of the pregnancy abortion
1	yeah okay
0	i'm there as well
1	okay yeah because i mean in um even when there's no heartbeart they're still alive the cells are still forming so it's a form of life it's living it's not breathing yet but it's still alive
1	just like um as small as the um like the fertilized cell is think about like how big the world is and how small we are and we're still i'm still standing next to you and you seem pretty big to me so there's no like evidence to prove that like premature um fetuses have like sensations but they probably do
0	yeah and actually there in later years children who are born prematurely theire survival rate it's increased and the age at which a child can survive hows um they can survive a younder age so i think that's just all the more proof that they are alive and they humans and it would be murder to kill them
1	and i think about things like i'm really um like oriented to believe that everyone has like a purpose and so killing a fetus they could have children too one day and they won't impact the world either because they won't have been given a chance so that's another thing i consider too
1	there's a lot of people to like you see on tv and you read about it like women who have fertility issues that would love to have someone else's baby some who has one is trying to just say like it's not important to them so
0	i think for many women who decide to abort there's the fear of telling people your pregnant and like the lack of resources to go through a pregnancy um so i feel like those are something that is more important to address or make available rather than making abortion more available um as an option
1	yeah i think that the government could play a role in this to by not only um you know making it illegal to abort but also they could contribute more resources to you know places that want people to adopt and then so they could find children in need and you know financial resources and stuff to so
0	uh do you consider with birth control to be part of that at all or are you for birth control?
1	um like i'm i consider abortion to be wrong but some people take birth control for other problems and stuff you know
0	so your okay with the idea of birth control?
1	i think it's okay if it's for like purposes like people take it for like really bad acne problems people take it for health too so i think that's
0	uh huh
0	uh huh
0	so in that regard you're you're okay with birth control but as far as like preventing pregnancy you aren't and [..]
1	i think that i agree with that
0	okay okay i'm just trying to figure out where you stand so so you think that abortion should be illegal
1	i though considering like birth control i think that if more like if birth control was available more um like it would be less likely that people would want to abort obviously but then again you have to think i'm not sure where i stand on this if it's okay for like plan parenthood to give out birth control to sixteen year olds i don't really think that's okay i'm not sure exactly what age i think is okay if i think about it
0	okay yeah um i think with the availability of birth control it could help with the numbers as far as abortions um but i think too a lot of it has to do with education and the educational safe sex because i go to college and i know people who have had abortions and a lot of times they become pregnant and they have access to birth control and they're on it but they just aren't wise about how they use it so perhaps i'd be more in favor of working on that spot um starting with birth control and then maybe making your way more towards making your way towards legalizing abortion because yeah
1	yeah i agree with that too because there's a lot of people who just aren't very educated and they don't take the proper precautions which leads to them to needing to get an abortion so that's not really that's not really a good thing but um i think that if sometimes education too but some people just they don't care so i don't i don't know how the government could force them to care but education
