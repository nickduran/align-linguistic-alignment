0	I'm (formal) against because I'm for and against it.
1	You are both for and against? All right.
0	# kind of
0	Cause human rights and another one's like well if you kill five millions of people yeah you should die. What do you think?
1	Well I think I'm um I'm for death penalty because if you kill somebody you know you deserve to be killed too and you're taking away say like if you like murdered or raped like a woman and killed it like killed her not it then like you know you're taking away somebody's life like from somebody's family and I feel like as a result you know you should deserve to die too and take the pain that you committed for someone else's life and you should feel the pain in everything you have done to somebody. And I also think that it's a waste of money for us to like keep you alive $. Because you know how like in jail you know people have to pay for food and clothes and tax and electricity for you to be still living in jail but not having to go anywhere else. I mean that's painful you know and emotionally to be in jail and not being able to see the outside world you're just being in a cage something like that that I think that's like we as citizens we have to pay for it so I think like you know might as well just kill you if you're sentenced to like life then you're going to be dying anyway so why waste more money and keep you alive and feed you so I think yeah I think death penalty yeah is like better.
0	*that's true
0	life then like you should die*
0	But then it's also like second chances like if you kill a lot and then you've done a lot of horrible things then yeah you should die because either way you will have the death penalty but if it's like you don't have the death penalty you have like 15 to 20 years then you shouldn't die because it's like a second chance cause for 15 20 years you wouldn't commit that much crime I don't think I don't know the murder years but if you have the death then yeah you should $ go away but if there's a second chance like you know that person might there's a possibility cause there's a lot of people who grow from jail as a person so
1	Yeah but then I still believe when you take away somebody's life then
0	Yeah if it's an accident that's another case as well but you can't prove it though so either way
1	If it's an accident yeah but*
1	I mean it would be sad at the same time it would be like our being um how do I say um being uh wrongly accused and nobody backed it up for you and you're going to be put in death penalty yeah that's uh negative thing but uh but yeah I mean there's a chance I think I think like a lot of death penalty probably like
0	is that a chance you're willing to take?*
0	They're not the real person who committed the murder
1	Yeah they could be accused of doing it yeah I think like there was um there was a case where I forgot the guy's name he's like at 17 he was like um he was at the wrong place at the wrong time
0	#yeah cause the phrenology and stuff
0	Was it because of race they got him?
1	Oh no it was just a little like he was 17 he was a young black guy and then and um there was a shooting you know there was a shooting and I think it killed a white police guy and it wasn't like he was being executed but people kept you know the human rights um and yeah just
0	#was it really
0	I'm on the fence that's all I'm saying like if it's like lifetime in jail then yeah you should die but if its 30 years or less maybe you should get a second chance cause maybe
1	Well he'd be old and when he came out you know when they come out what do they have left?
0	What if they're like 17 when they went to jail so like a 30 year won't do like they're forty they're still young
1	They'll be missing out so much already
0	he's willing to die $
1	Yeah why don't you just die $
0	So people might say that human rights they need to live how do you argue that?
1	What is it?
0	human rights
1	what about it?
0	how we argue that they just should die even with human rights
1	well i mean i think that they don't if i believe in human rights they shouldn't even kill the person in the first place
0	So what you believe is if you're for human rights then they won't let that guy die?
1	alright if the person okay*
1	Well I mean he he I mean he deserves what he did you know it invades human rights um whatever he committed uh in the first place what he did was like against human rights also but well to punish him it's also human rights then you know at the same time you have to think is what about the human rights for that person who already died
0	Or if you let him go if he commits more murders
1	Yeah you don't want to like a serial killer to come back and kill more people so we always have to be careful like when you give somebody like human rights so I mean if he if he comes back around and prove to people that you know he can be trusted and like commit more murders then yeah but I don't think $ I don't think I would give a serial killer a second chance regardless of the rights like he deserves to be living no I don't want to waste more money to jail
0	I just like but if he's not the murderer though so you're just killing off someone
1	The the thing is you can't prove it
0	There are ways like there was this case 20 30 years ago when a lot of people would commit a rape like they didn't have like the technology to test if that was his DNA or not but now like they brought the cases back with the technology to prove it wasn't a murder or like the rape or the rapist was actually this guy her neighbor so they let him go so yeah
1	So he was being killed for the
0	he was he was like in jail for it
1	was he killed or?
0	He wasn't killed but he was in jail for a long time now I think he's been released for like 20 years but still he was a good guy so like what if you killed someone and next week you're like oh wait the murderer's right here and we just killed someone and hurt their whole entire family by killing their son or husband so that's why
1	just in jail for a long time okay*
1	That's yeah that's kind of yeah that's a little bit different I guess in a way cause well when death penalty is really serious and you really need to have a lot of like uh proof that the person really did it so it's I think it to go to the point where it's death penalty it's like the court has to be really sure of it unless it's like back in the days when there's like no DNA testing
0	#the serious thing is like (incident)
0	There are some cases like with lawyers where actually they're guilt free but like (something's missing)
1	well if they win then yeah
0	Yeah that I'm not sure how I feel like he deserves death but lawyers don't want him killed so okay
