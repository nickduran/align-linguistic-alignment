1	 yeah most definitely i feel like the problem that growing up is that a lot of we're so stuck in a genereation where we're kind of confused because our parents our generation has evolved so fast that our parents haven't been able to adapt to that and our parents grew up in a generation generation where they where they were taught that man and woman and that's how the marriage should be you should have kids and that's how it should grow but i feel like gay people don't really have a choice like i don't think they grow like they're born and they're like alright well i like girls and thenthe next day they're like i like boys i mean as a child you grow up and you don't really think about things but i think in your mind and you miht say you are a since the day your born you already have that kind of idea of what you like and what you don't like like there's something that that that's not gonna change who your personality and people are like well i can go to i can go to a psychologist and they can change who i like i feel like at that point your not your not truly gay you're just confused of what you like because i feel like that's someone that is truly gay that they're not gonna change their mindset because of what someone tells tells them or kind of messes with their brain what they like and then because of that you're just kind of confused and but if you're truly like if you're truly gay and you're you're not gonna be able to change someone you're not gonna you they might feed you like feed back lik eoh so hpw are you feeling they're gonna be like well you know what i think i might like somebody else or i think i like men now like if a woman tells you that like if you go a woman walks into a psycho a psychologist and they tell them that then she's probably gonna be like well this guy's telling me so much information that i just wanna kind of get him off my back so that that's what they're gonna tell them just to make them happy but i don't think you can really honestly change someone that is truly gay like okay	[yeah, most, definitely, i, feel, like, the, problem, that, growing, up, is, that, a, lot, of, we, are, so, stuck, in, a,

1	yeah i feel like the like the us in general maybe not just a there are states where they're they are more lenient about it but i feel like the us in general though the us is pretty like like bad about it like they don't want to accept that people are gay like it happens people are gay like you can't change that you're not gonna be able to change someone so that i feel like the us kind of neglects people that are gay and it kind of puts down so whenever you see like a a gay couple like you instinct is not because you don't you're no like you don't accept gay people because of how society has set it up like you're kind of like whoa they're kind of gay i don't know like you're kind of like you kind of second thought them and if you see a straight couple like a man and a woman then you're noit gonna second thought them you're gonna just think it's normal but i think as a society and like other generation that we grew up think everyone telling us gay people are bad like you can't do that like you need to like a girl and then you're like man and the way we were taught is now that we're older it's kind of harder to comprehend like a gay relationship and it's really gonna come down to your personality and if you're willing to accept that because people like like i have a lot of friends that like they're like i can't believe you did you see that dude like they're gay like i can't believe they're holding hands i'm like well like you're kind of like being like you're kind of neglecting them because of becasue of who they like like it's like even if in a straight marriage like like say you like somebody and they're like i can't believe you're dating her like you're still gonna be like well it's the preson i like and it's the same thing with gay marriage like if you like somebody you're not gonna be able to not like them because of who they are like i think it goes further than just the like like the relationship it goes more into the personality of one person like they have to kind of be able to accept them and if you can't then i feel like it has come down to a lot where it's how you were raised because your parents told you so much and they kind of like closed mind you	[yeah, i, feel, like, the, like, the, us, in, general, maybe, not, just, a, there, are, states, where, they, are, they, are, more, lenient, about, it, but, i, feel, like, the,
