there was even a whole seperation between church and state established way before the eighteen hundreds or the nineteen hundreds at least and that promise have stayed um really strongly ever since it's coming between political machines and the eighteen hundreds or late eighteen hundreds especially with  where there's  and i think it that's it's a promise that should really be upheld because of that okay because if your going to do it to one thing you have to keep it uniformed and keep it so that other social groups can be accepted or whatever it is that your talking about there has to be a seperation between the government and private entities you know you can't have like a mixing between the two by private entities in this case i mean the church at least yeah you can't mix them both up even tho a lot of people try to make the argument that america was founded by god and it's through his graces that we're able to do you know that's their own beliefs but aside from that we had to write a constitution that protected the rights of every single individual and one of the interesting things about the constitution is that you basically the freedom you have the freedom to be yourself as long as you don't hurt other people or get in the way of other people's freedoms	[alright, so, the, topic, we, were, given, is, gay, marriage, and, okay, personally, i, think, that, you, know, it,
