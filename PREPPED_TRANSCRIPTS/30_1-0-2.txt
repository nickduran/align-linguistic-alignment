1	 i personally think that they should just get married but most of the time if gay people want to get married it is for legal reasons like because when they go to the hospital they want to be able to show their insurance because that is what you can do with your spouse like when you are married like a heterosexual marriage so if they were to create their own union with the same rights you know that would be alright but i personally think that this separate but equal thing is very civil rightsesque and i just think that they should be able to get like married and a marriage like the scientific like the phrase is basically like two people like becoming like a a person like a one entity and becoming like just their lives are melded together and that is basically what would happen if like they got like unioned or something which is basically the same word so calling it marriage is just is just a word and your beliefs are still strong in that so like i do not think we should create a different entity i think they should just get married because it would take so much legal like jargon to start like that process and just get letting them get married they could start like their lives and we could just go on with ours	[i, personally, think, that, they, should, just, get, married, but, most, of, the, time, if, gay, people, want, to, get, married, it, is, for, legal,
