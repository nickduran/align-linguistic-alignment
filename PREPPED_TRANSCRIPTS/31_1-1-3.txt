1	i do not i just thought it was like all relevant until like if you make less you should be taxed less if you make more a little bit more you should be taxed a little bit more if you make a lot more you should be taxed more just because because like the majority of people who are rich like they they are rich because of inheritance or they are rich because they own companies or rich because of this and yeah they all worked really hard but the middle class works just as hard but it is not constantly coming in whereas a lot of rich americans like it is consistent and it is not that they have to continue working whereas a middle class americans will have to work their entire life and the i from my understanding the whole point of like paying taxes and stuff is to go into your cities and to go into your public schools and to go into all of these things that everyone uses and like for instance like my parents like we are middle class they  like worked like like double jobs to send me to private school but they also payed their taxes for public school you know like taxes like that would go to things like public schools that we do not use but it would it is still important for people who make less money than us to have that opportunity to go to that to go to public schools and to have like like good roads and to have whatever it is that taxes pay for	[i, do, not, i, just, thought,
