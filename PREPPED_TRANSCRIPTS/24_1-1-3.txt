1	i i am not saying we should leave one hundred percent completely and have no people there i just think that the fact that we just keep sending more and more troops and supposedly we are bringing a lot back but we are not and then more troops are going in i think that is the problem that we are spending so much money for more people to more marines or i am not exactly sure what the proper term is or soldiers to go back and i just think a lot of them just need to come home and a lot of them are being having to extend their tours and i do not think that is right and a lot of them are being asked to extend their tours and you know they have families they have a life here so i think there should be a way that you know once they are done with their tour they should not have to feel guilty to start a new tour and i know that technically they can leave but it is kind of hard to when they are like well there is a war going on and they just i just think that a lot of them just it be preferred if only some stay where they can go back and forth instead of having a bunch of like thousands of them over there then yeah and it is like a lot of money that between like i forgot how much money just one day if were to stop doing just one day i helps so much in the economy just one day of stopping the war because there is a lot of money that goes into that and education is not budgets are being cut for the ucs budgets are being cut for everything else but you do not see a budget being cut for the iraq war because that is what they think is necessary and it is not fair for everyone and it just seems like a lot of people that they just want it to end because a lot of blood is being shed that is not necessary so yeah	[i, i, am, not, saying, we, should, leave, one, hundred,

1	yeah but i mean we have problems too in america but we would not like it if someone stepped in and be like this is how it should be done we have problems that go on we have homeless people all around we have lots of problems but we would not want another country stepping in and being like well this is how things should be and a lot of men walking around with guns so i am thinking even though we are helping the fact that there is so many troops back there is also threatening i mean it is not like they are just walking around helping everybody i mean there is a reason why they carry guns and i am not saying they should not because it is in their safety to but it is not like we are just helping them build houses over there and helping their electricity because they do not get electricity for twenty four hours which they never have a day of that for the most part and i just think that if we were to help in those situations then yeah i think our money is well spent but we do not we are there for another we are not there for that that is not our main agenda there we do not just go to random places and try to help just for that if we did we did not have to carry guns so i am just saying it needs to be it needs to be less troops there just because one it is threatening and we are not getting at least as a public we do not know what we are getting out of it maybe they do maybe there is something good we know or we do not know but the fact that we do not know is a problem and i think we should have some information because we are paying for it we are funding it so i think it is not fair that we do not have any information on why we are still sending many troops there and they are stating that they are sending a lot of troops home but there is still a lot over there	[yeah, but, i, mean, we, have, problems, too, in, america, but, we, would, not, like, it, if, someone, stepped, in, and, be, like, this, is, how, it, should, be, done, we, have, problems, that,

think that in politics there is always a hidden agenda and i have taken poli sci and it just seems like they promise one thing to get in the door and they do another once they are there so i just do not think they will ever tell the public the entire truth because they feel like they do not one they do not no one tells them they have to and two they do not think we could handle it and or we are going to do with the information so i just feel like they keep us you know like blinded when it comes to anything like that they just tell us what they want to know and even like journalists they have to tell us what they believe and it is even if they try to stay biased it is kind of hard to like even journals even like what is it called newspapers they are biased because they try to sell to the public they they do not just sell they sell newspapers if they in a democratic demographic they are going to lean more those newspapers are going to have more democratic you know good stuff and look on the republicans as bad just because of the fact that they are in a democratic area and then if you are in a republican area the newspapers are more republican positive and you know because they are selling newspapers they are selling you the news it is kind of hard to believe anything you read nowadays because everyone has an opinion and it is kind of hard to not state your opinion in whatever

1	i mean there is our safety and i am not saying i am not thankful that there is people out there that are protecting our safety i just feel like because we do not know exactly what they are doing and if there is any progress of why they are still there and if you if i had that piece of information then yeah then maybe it is a good thing that they are there but i do not and they do not tell me anything because they do not want to tell me anything  they do not tell the public that much they tell you exactly what you want to hear or you know they always tell you troops are being sent back home and everything is good and they do not you know there is that i think i forgot what it is called it is like the leaky something leaked on the internet and it was leaky something about bad things that they are doing over there the guy got in huge trouble for it but it was like videos of people being tortured and some things that soldiers are not supposed to do and very really bad stuff and like people did not want to know it and some people are like it is not true and then you know so i do not you know troops being there for a really long time is also bad for their mental health because they come back and some can not sleep some have issues some have really psychological issues let us not forget the physical issues and i just think that if you are going to have troops there have them for a certain amount of time but not too long because some of the things that they see does mess with their mental health and i do not exactly want a bunch of troops that have their mental health not stable to you know	[i, mean, there, is, our, safety, and, i, am, not, saying, i, am, not, thankful, that, there, is, people, out, there, that, are, protecting, our, safety, i, just, feel, like,
